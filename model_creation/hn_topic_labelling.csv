It operates in an infinite and timeless environment. Since there is no time in its environment, it doesn’t even make sense to talk about processing speed as each operation is atemporal. This agent does not have memory limits as the space it can access is infinite. Its intelligence includes all the others within it, in the same way that the infinite power set of complex numbers contains within it all the combinations of minor power sets.
There is no limit to the computational problems it can solve, it is however subject to the limits of formal systems, in the sense that it cannot solve, for example, Turing’s halting problem.<p>[PDS: If it were to exist, then -- <i>I wouldn&#x27;t be so sure about that!</i>  That&#x27;s because if it existed, it would, of necessity, include the ability to <i>solve and resolve what humans, especially human philosophers (with the possible exception of Zen Masters) call Paradoxes...</i> You know, like The Irresistable Force Vs. The Immovable Object -- which wins?  Etc., etc., etc...]<p>It is instantly aware of any state of consciousness that may exist, its existence is a continuum of qualia, an eternal kaleidoscopic ocean of experiences.

563,"&gt; If Covid turns out to be a lab escape (which is a big if),<p>It seems like we don&#x27;t have evidence, but the natural evolutionary experiment that&#x27;s occurred provides a staggering amount. We can see from the virus phylogeny that:<p>1. The virus entered the human population in October 2019. All known SARS2 sequences are related in a single clade that, under very soft assumptions about mutation rate, would coalesce in late fall 2019. The first sequences we got, in early 2020, had only a handful of mutations between them. Nothing has ever arisen outside of this clade.<p>2. The virus entered humans with it&#x27;s spike protein already fully adapted to the human ACE receptor protein. We can see this because there was not an accelerated evolution in this protein. We did not see changes in the viral genome resulting in a significant phenotypic change until the b.1.1.7 and other &quot;third wave&quot; variants arose. This stands in intense contrast to every other zoonotic transfer we know of. Adaptation always occurs because biology is different enough that different viral configurations provide immediate gain, and through continuous mutation the virus is exploring a huge space of these all the time. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t mutate rapidly indicates it is near a strong local optimum.<p>One way of understanding the significance of this is by thinking of the virus as a learned model which is learning a solution to the problem of its own survival. What this evidence shows is that is appeared already optimized. We see this because over an incredible number of update steps (many quadrillions perhaps, with each human infection being like a minibatch, and each viral replication like a step) there was no significant reduction in test loss (viral survival). We randomly picked a perfect initial model. Either that first virus was lucky in a way that is similar to guessing a perfect solution, which has a probability so low as to be fanciful, or it had already in incorporated all the readily-usa le information about the human ACE receptor.<p>Do we have evidence? What is the probability of this pattern occuring in the case of a natural spillover? It&#x27;s 1:atoms-in-the universe level. Finding a virus already so optimized to humans by randomly sampling from existing ones is like the kind of collision probability level that we comfortably use to build cryptocurrency castles that assume key non-collision. In the case of a virus optimized by serial passage in the lab? Frankly it&#x27;s indistinguishable from that.",science,science,finance

Refinery is a chrome extension that lets you edit your website in-browser and then lets you push the changes live instantly.<p>After building a Shopify app, there were so many times when we wanted to quickly change some copy here and there, but didn’t want to have to start our dev environment, open our text editor, make the change, create a branch, create a PR, … you get it. Luckily our team is 3 software engineers, but it got us thinking around how our first marketing or sales hire would make these changes.<p>The current version of Refinery essentially turns your existing website into a CMS. Right now you can use Refinery to tweak copy, but more functionality is coming soon. Specifically, we’re working on adding the ability to tweak CSS, add links &amp; tooltips to copy, and run A&#x2F;B tests on different possible tweaks… all which can be done in-browser.<p>We’ve on-boarded a few companies in the past week where Refinery is typically being used by non-engineers (founders, PMs, &amp; marketers) who don’t want to bother engineers with small copy tweaks.<p>Installation is really easy. Install our chrome extension, add a JS snippet to your head tag, and you’re good to go:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;refinery-editor&#x2F;pmfpnhdkcikalnldmkmcofllbdbannhh<p>We’d love to hear what the HN community thinks!

81,"I need advice on how to operate effectively as a software engineer in an environment where nearly all technical infrastructure is broken. For context, I work in a portion of a large tech company that straddles research and product development. The single biggest problem that I face at work is that nearly every piece of technical infra that our team (and therefore I) owns + rely on is broken. Let me paint a picture of what this looks like on a daily basis–<p>In order to complete a task for a project, I typically need to invoke a hand-full of binaries that our team owns. My experience shows that the percentage of time that a binary &quot;just works&quot; on the first try is vanishingly small. To say &lt;1% would be a generous view. To be fair, for internal infrastructure &quot;just working&quot; is perhaps an unrealistic expectation. However, the percentage of time that I can get a binary to run after less than an hour of debugging &#x2F; reading  source is probably around 5%. Further still, the percentage of time that I end up spending _several_ days debugging a binary just to get it to run is over 50%.<p>This results in me feeling awful about my level of productivity, but strangely not many others in my team express this as being a significant problem for them.<p>What causes this problem is that our team and larger area invests practically zero resources to developing robust infrastructure which leaves us with many half-baked tools written by researchers just trying to perform their single experiment and then move on. Since I joined I have been trying (really really trying) to do what I can to fix broken infra that plagues our team but as an IC that is given zero incentive &#x2F; time to work on this– its like trying to move the ocean.<p>My questions are these –<p><pre><code>  1) is this kind of environment common for software engineers?

When I was working for a fintech company, we built a suite of specs for a ledger. Based on those specs we could generate data. And it wasn&#x27;t just some set of key&#x2F;value pairs with completely randomized numbers. It would generate &quot;a proper&quot; ledger, where every number in a transaction depends on other transactions.<p>We used that generated data to render UI locally and on the non-prod environments.<p>Using the same specs we build data validators, we re-used the specs to validate data in the input fields in the UI.

This blob can be moved around, synced and updated however I like, with zero concern about who has a copy of it.<p>2. I decrypt this blob locally on device, using a combination of multiple factors such as what I know (a passphrase) and what I have (e.g. a copy of a static but un-guessable and un-rememberable account key, which is copied to all my devices, potentially stored at rest inside a secure enclave).<p>3. The decrypted blob then authenticates me on services using data which is entirely random and arbitrary.<p>I could only imagine how much more perfect this arrangement could be with total industry uniformity.

You can&#x27;t accidentally use a `std::optional&lt;file_contents_t&gt;` as a `file_contents_t`, but you can accidentally use a `file_contents_t` with `.valid = false` where one with `.valid = true` was expected.<p>- The `img = crop_to_cat(img); img = add_bow_tie(img); ...` example looks great when you just call the functions in sequence and expect each function to be a no-op for invalid inputs. But this breaks down when you have loops or logging or sleeps or other side effects that you genuinely want to skip. At that point you will have to start checking `if (img.valid)` manually again anyway. And if there are enough of these scattered around multiple scopes, you&#x27;ll end up wanting `goto error` again.<p>The callback-based example with `std::optional` as well as the Rust example with early returns don&#x27;t have these problems.

My parents are old-timers living in the Irish countryside. When I was growing up in the early 80s, you couldn&#x27;t get one-tenth the stuff I now eat a daily basis. I became a vegetarian  by first developing a love for cooking (especially Indian). When you have a wide range of tastes, and the supermarkets stock everything you need, it&#x27;s easy to find alternative to meat. Otherwise, it takes a long time to expand your tastes and learn what to actually do with ingredients. My mother walks around the supermarket at the weekend, and still picks up the same old things she used to get in the 80s. She wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with 90% of the herbs and spices on my shelf. So asking her to cut out the one tasty part of her daily meal is pointless, not to mention unhealthy (she would have low b12 and iron).<p>If I were a meat eater planning to go vegetarian I would avoid cold turkey (not a pun). Phase it out. Maybe start with the biggest greenhouse emitters (cow), or the most intelligent (pig). Maybe give up fowl and fish last. Rather than see it as a limitation, start by learning how to cook one new meal every week that is nutritious, tasty and <i>also</i> meat free. Also, if someone else is doing all the hard work (ie: you&#x27;re in a restaurant or ordering delivery) use that as an opportunity to try different things that don&#x27;t have meat. Indian food is great for this because it&#x27;s not just &quot;meat and potatoes without the meat&quot; or their vegetarian food is amazing.

511,"I lived in the rural Palouse growing up. That region is responsible for producing a lot of the lentils, dry peas, chickpeas, et al in the US. There is a wide range of local cuisine in that region based on those ingredients that is absurdly delicious that I’ve never seen anywhere else. There are a lot of recipes online but they are materially different. There are distant analogues of some of it (e.g. falafel or some Indian cuisine) but it is pretty different from that. This was home food on the farms.<p>The thing to understand about legumes is that some of them, with appropriate preparation, can constructively absorb prodigious quantities of salt and fat. For example, you can fry lentils, which are delicious on their own (I think these are eaten in the Middle East), but that can be a prep step for further processing. Many people make cakes or patties, often pan frying them. Addictive as hell and salty, and you can’t eat a lot of it, but it tastes amazing and various forms are sometimes used as a meat alternative e.g. with eggs for breakfast.<p>The caveat, which I’ve learned the hard way, is that there is quite a bit of non-obvious knowledge on how to process the legumes for these dishes, and it has multiple stages. Texture and consistency control, as well as the interplay of oil and water, is not trivial. Lentils are the most complicated but also the most interesting, but the multiple processing steps are more work than is convenient. I left when I was a kid, so I’ve spent a lot of time trying to figure it out by trial and error. When I travel back there, local restaurants still serve these kinds of things.

270,"One counterpoint against 1), and what eventually pushed me to stop eating meat, is the supposed humane slaughtering of the animals. It is not humane at all, and there is a lot of malpractice against the animals while they are in the slaughterhouse. There was a broadcast on Dutch television highlighting these issues. If your stomach can handle it; here is the link, but I warn it is very expressive:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=g2bwr7RotAs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=g2bwr7RotAs</a>
(~2m40 people reacting to what you will see; ~3m23 the actual footage)<p>To be sure, this is not some incident but some fundamental issue throughout the industry (at least in the Netherlands). There is only one big company responsible for most of the slaughtering. The government bodies supposed to be monitoring their practices had their budget cuts for years and now it turns out they can no longer do their job, and are said to be part of the problem. It is hard to give citations here because most of it is in Dutch, I am not sure about the situation in the US.<p>Slowly but surely there are more biological farms operating in the Netherlands, but still these animals are slaughtered at the same slaughterhouses the factory animals are slaughtered at. I am afraid there is no good story here.<p>Another counterpoint is; you are talking about cattle, but what about pigs and chicken for example? They are not happily grazing on some green meadow, but mostly always indoors (talking Netherlands here again), being overfed to grow as fast as possible, get as many piglets or produce as much meat in a as short amount of time as possible, then to be butchered in some awful way if they are unlucky. It takes very little effort to find mountains of footage of animals being mistreated on farms all over the world.<p>So I don&#x27;t think the assumptions you make in 1) hold. There is no way to ensure that the meat you are eating (even biological meat), is from an animal that was treated respectfully during its lifetime and slaughtered in a humane way.<p>Ad 2), by the fatalistic argument, a whole lot of things no longer make sense (who would you vote, your vote does not matter). But consider the network effect you may have in your decision to no longer eat meat, and for example start making too long comments on HN to try to convince other people to stop eating meat.

249,"There&#x27;s a bunch of things you can do in C to &quot;clue in&quot; the compiler on what your code is going to do.<p>The easiest is using the preprocessor to hardcode values such that branches can be eliminated. This is nice and all but it can start to cause problems with things getting confusing.<p>---<p>The other common thing you can do is provide compiler attributes to hint at what the code is doing. For example, you can specify that a function is pure (doesn&#x27;t affect the observable state of the program) or const (pure attribute with the addition that the function is not affected by changes to anything other than the inputs. i.e. same inputs always give you the same output). There are also cold&#x2F;hot attributes for improving branch prediction.<p>Similarly there is the leaf attribute which restricts the control flow of a function largely to the current translation unit and allows the compiler to deduce significantly more information about what the code is intending to do.<p>---<p>Now on the more fancy&#x2F;dangerous side is using strict aliasing, the restrict keyword, and array parameters in functions. Strict aliasing tells the compiler that types can only contain what they say they contain (i.e. any two pointers for the same location in memory must have the same type).<p>Likewise the restrict keyword states that any memory accessed by a restrict qualified pointer can only be accessed by that pointer or by pointers derived from said pointer (member accesses, array access, pointer sliding&#x2F;offsets). This allows the compiler to know that memory isn&#x27;t being touched by other accesses (which without restrict it could be). Realistically this allows you some small to large performance gains any time you are interacting with more than one pointer at a time as the alternative is that the compiler may have to recheck every cached value any time you write to another pointer. An example would be `f(char * restrict x, char * restrict y)`. Here you know that no value ever possibly accessed or written to in x will affect any value ever possibly accessed or written to in y and vice versa. Note that the restrict keyword is valid on variables, pointers, members, and arrays.<p>In a similar vein, you can leverage array arguments in functions to guarantee to the compiler that a pointer argument is non-null and contains some number of elements. For example the difference between the functions `f(char * x)`, `g(char y [5])`, and `h(char z [static 5]` is that the compiler can&#x27;t necessarily know for sure that x is a valid address in memory or how many elements it contains. The compiler does however know that the variable y contains exactly 5 elements and that the variable z contains at minimum 5 elements. The compiler can now potentially elide null checks and bounds checks (say for null terminated strings). Since the function is aware of this, it may help a bit but it benefits more in that with inlined functions, macros, and LTO the compiler can optimise within the scope of said function trees to elide those checks&#x2F;branches. Something to note because people don&#x27;t always pick up on it, array arguments do in fact work with size 1 which allows you to specify that all your arguments are guaranteed valid pointers. Basically for any internal functions, you probably always want to use either an array argument over a pointer so you can elide null checks and the like.<p>---<p>Combining all of the above in a C project can sufficiently restrict the search space so that the compiler can elide most &quot;unused&quot; code sections, restructure a decent bit of branching code into branch free forms (since it can be deduced equivalent at compile time), and reasonably tag the branch weights for the remaining branches.<p>TLDR: Yes however some of the techniques come with the downside that if the code doesn&#x27;t fit the requirements of the technique the optimisations can introduce bugs into the program. There are some levels of compiler warnings to help you when using these features but they only catch the obvious cases (since if they could catch all of them, they could implement the techniques automatically). It&#x27;s C, it comes with its footguns but if you know how to use them, you&#x27;ll probably only be burned a few times and hopefully not too badly.",technology,technology,

It proceeds from a false premise “non-white solidarity” that’s broke by the use of wedge issues. The opposite is true: Asians have distinct interests and people trying to get them to support affirmative action measures are trying to get them to vote against their own interests. Ibram Kendi-style “equity”—where races are represented in proportion to their share of the population—would be disastrous for Asians. We would go from 20-40% in top universities to 6%. We’d go from 35% in Silicon Valley to 6%-10%. And that’s not a hypothetical thing. I went to TJHSST, where progressives voted to eliminate the admissions test. That will cut Asians from 70% to 20%. NYC is trying to do the same thing.<p>Asians, and to a great extent Latinos, have very little self-interest in rocking the boat. While immigrants in Europe are seeing generational poverty, Asians and Latinos enjoy similar or even higher levels of income mobility as whites. Cubans and Vietnamese came over as refugees with nothing, and achieved economic parity with white Americans within a single generation. There’s only a handful of countries (UK, Canada, Australia) where that sort of thing happens. We have very little self interest in messing with the current system.<p>It’s fair to argue that we should give up some of our privilege to help reduce systemic disparities. But that’s a completely different argument. But telling us that these changes are in our own self interest, because the existing system is racist against us, is just gaslighting.<p>&gt; And just because some Asian populations are doing well, doesn&#x27;t mean that _all_ of them are.<p>Yes, virtually all of them are. When you see people incoming intra-Asian disparities it’s almost invariably based on pointing to Asian groups that are recent immigrants. That’s why you suddenly started seeing articles about the plight of “Bhutanese Americans.” Virtually all of them came here during the Obama administration, as refugees. They might be poor now, but that’s to be expected at this stage.<p>I’m Bangladeshi. Bangladeshi Americans are one of the poorer Asian groups. But Indian Americans are one of the richest. That’s not the product of “racism”—that would be absurd, even we can’t usually tell each other apart by sight. Instead it’s because Indians started immigrating in the 1960s and Bangladeshis only did so in significant numbers since the 2000s. But even Asian groups who come here in poverty quickly move up the ladder. In 1980, Vietnamese were among the poorest ethnic groups, having come here as refugees.

180,"&gt; Is it really unethical to eat animals when the natural trajectory of most animals lives was likely to be eaten by other animals or die some horrendous death<p>The <i>vast</i> majority of meat that we produce isn&#x27;t sparing animals that would have died anyway, it&#x27;s not from hunting. We bring animals into existence (lots and lots of them, more than would naturally exist) for the sole purpose of killing them. Whether or not that distinction resonates with you morally -- different people have different reactions to that. But for me, it feels tangibly different.<p>I also think about it from an individual perspective instead of a societal perspective. I stopped thinking about a binary &quot;is it ever wrong to eat meat in any situation&quot; question, and the question I started asking instead was &quot;do I need to?&quot; The answer to that question doesn&#x27;t change just because of what the food chain is, or what animals would do to me if they got the chance, or what tigers do in the wild, or whether deer like being eaten by wolves. Those systems might exist, but do I need to be a part of them?<p>Nearly all life on earth exploits other life to live. Humans aren&#x27;t an exception to that, <i>I&#x27;m</i> not an exception to that. But if I can reduce my level of exploitation at little cost to me, then I want to. I don&#x27;t buy that I would be killing animals as an act of charity, I know myself too well. For me personally, I can&#x27;t pretend that I was eating chicken because I cared about the animals.<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t it better for an animal to live its best life on a free range farm being grass fed, then get quickly and humanely slaughtered?<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a scalable model for food production. My personal experience has been that choosing to eat only ethically sourced meat is more expensive and more difficult than going vegetarian. And I am doubtful even in a perfect world that free range farms with humane slaughterhouses would be capable of providing the amount of meat that people want to eat today. I think in order for that to happen, at the very least a lot of other people would need to go vegetarian or significantly reduce their meat intake.<p>What you&#x27;re asking is a complicated question, and different people have different answers to it, and even saying something like &quot;killing animals is unethical&quot; is itself a really broad answer that means different things to different people. <i>But</i> I feel reasonably confident today saying that inhumane treatment of animals is built into the agriculture industry at a very fundamental level, and I sort of think it&#x27;s naive to say that&#x27;s going to change. I see more people becoming vegetarian at a faster rate than I see people opting to find a local farmer that can supply them with local free range beef. And as uncomfortable as it might be to say, most of the meat you see in a store came from animals that led horrible lives before they were butchered in horrible ways.<p>So on some level, I feel like the underlying ethical question of &quot;do animals exist for food&quot; is kind of besides the point, because even if they do exist for food, I don&#x27;t see any evidence that we can keep meat production going at the same rate and at the same cost without being cruel to animals. I see a lot of people who <i>want</i> to believe that we can do free-range happy cows, but... everything I know about economy of scale contradicts that idea.<p>&gt; If I made a personal decision to stop eating meat, would there be any significant impact at all on the overall environment realistically?<p>Maybe people can debate this, I can&#x27;t say with certainty that insulating your house really well or reducing driving wouldn&#x27;t be comparable in some cases. But most information I have seen suggests to me that for most people, eliminating meat (or even just reducing it) is one of the single highest-impact actions any individual can take for their own lives. So if you are looking for ways to reduce your personal environmental impact, then yes, reducing (or eliminating) meat does help at least as much as anything else you can do.<p>But, let&#x27;s get to the rest of your question:<p>&gt; However, the reality is that me (not) eating a bowl of sashimi once a week makes no difference in the context of, say, countries like Japan slaughtering millions of fish daily<p>Correct, but here&#x27;s the thing. Literally nothing that you do to reduce your own individual emissions is ever going to be significant next to the impact of industry and government. You sort your plastic, great. The impact of doing that is negligible compared to a single bill that regulates how water bottles are made.<p>What makes vegetarianism promising is that there is genuinely a social shift happening on a wider scale than just with individuals, and that social shift has impact on industries. The biggest environmental impact of vegetarianism is when enough people shift that the meat industry overall starts to pivot or produce less meat, or where enough political pressure builds up that meat subsidies start to go away. The other thing that makes vegetarianism promising is that the more demand there is for meat substitutes, the cheaper those products become and the more resources are devoted into developing better products.<p>We saw a similar thing happen with green energy. Individual choices meant very little compared to the amount of energy that industries used. But at some point, green energy got cheap, and demand got higher, and companies started getting into it as well.<p>So I am cautious about telling people that what they do doesn&#x27;t matter, because a lot of this stuff only changes when a certain threshold of people start getting involved or putting pressure on politicians to make changes. I don&#x27;t want to pretend that reducing your own emissions is going to save the world, but I also disagree with the fatalism that says that individual choices don&#x27;t matter.<p>I don&#x27;t know if vegetarianism has enough momentum to significantly reduce meat demand, but it might. And when I look at the alternatives, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any chance at all that the ethical meat movement has enough momentum to change anything, so throwing weight behind the vegetarians is about as good a plan as anything else. Beyond Burgers might get cheaper than normal burgers at some point, and that could drive a large change in how restaurants source food and how normal people buy food. If enough people stop buying fish, commercial fishing might go down because of a loss of profits. But there is basically zero chance that free-range chicken eggs will ever be cheaper than caged eggs, or that fisheries are suddenly going to become sustainable out of the goodness of their own hearts.",science,science,

Furthermore, the other key feature thought to be instrumental in the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans—a polybasic cleavage site insertion in the S protein—has not yet been seen in another close bat relative of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</i><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-020-0771-4"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-020-0771-4</a>",science,science,

791,"No, sigh, it&#x27;s the other way around. The people who believe the law was broken were lied to, by a corrupt set of regulators. Very apt, given the topic here.<p>The Electoral Commission spent a long time trying to build cases against Leave campaigners. It did so because although theoretically neutral, like a lot of British government institutions it&#x27;s run by people who are openly biased and happy to make strongly political statements on the record. The EC is literally run by people who made public statements saying Brexit was bad and that they wanted Remain to win. Not a good start.<p>So they worked over-time to try and prosecute people who campaigned for Leave, but they themselves (fortunately!) do not have law enforcement powers. This is indeed fortunate because every single case they referred to the CPS and Police was dismissed on the grounds that no crime had actually been committed. The High Court has repeatedly criticised the EC for appearing not to know what electoral laws actually say. Or in other words, the people you are claiming &quot;officially found&quot; one side to have violated the law, had their investigations&#x2F;decisions labelled by the High Court as &quot;unconstructive&quot;, &quot;arbitrary&quot; and lacking &quot;any rational basis&quot; (quoting the judgement itself there).<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;order-order.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;14&#x2F;high-court-finds-electoral-commission-unfit-purpose&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;order-order.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;14&#x2F;high-court-finds-electora...</a><p>Part of the reason the EC&#x27;s arguments were dismissed is that the EC is responsible for issuing interpretations of electoral law. In at least one case, the Vote Leave campaign requested such an interpretation, was told what they were going to do was entirely legal and OK, and then later the EC changed its mind and decided to fine them for following the government&#x27;s official advice. That sort of thing is hard to explain: either the regulators are corrupt, or incompetent, or both, but it&#x27;s certainly not the fault of people who requested clarification about an unclear rule and then were, in effect, lied to about it.<p>The EC&#x27;s quite transparent campaign against anyone who campaigned for Brexit, certainly motivated by the biases of the people appointed to run it, is a classic case of exactly the same problem Americans are complaining about in this very thread w.r.t. net neutrality.

804,"&gt; but we shouldn&#x27;t forget survivor bias here<p>Hi HN, entrepreneurial scientist here. You have just given me an idea. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be posting this buried in the comments but can always be reposted elsewhere.<p>&quot;survivor bias&quot;<p>This is a constant talking point in HN. It allows anyone to plausibly dismiss absolutely any advice from a successful entrepreneur (no offence to the poster here intended, they may be right - it&#x27;s just that it can be used anywhere).<p>It&#x27;s so powerful, in fact, that the only plausible retort is to look to serial successful entrepreneurs - Jobs, Musk etc. - as evidence that it&#x27;s at least not entirely luck that leads to success. And even that counterargument is on shaky ground.<p>So what we need to do is to get more scientific. We need to know how many other startups were formed in that area, or with that idea, or just in general. I think this is totally doable. What we need is a bad ass business scientist in some university to take on this challenge. Actually, hell - this is a startup idea in itself. So it probably exists somewhere.<p>I would begin by monitoring all new company registrations in my home country (UK) and keeping a look out for tech startups. You can check their websites at regular intervals, look at Companies House metadata, and scrape news to classify them correctly. Monitor accounts returns to see when&#x2F;if they trade, and fold. Although it&#x27;d take time to build the database, after a year I think you&#x27;d already have interesting observations.<p>You could also do phone interviews with (a sample of?) founders. The goal would be to get them to almost &quot;register&quot; themselves in the same way as a medical trial might be registered. You&#x27;ll definitely have a problem with confidentiality, so you may need to delay the release of data by 10 years, or to release only aggregate data, or else to rely only on aggregating public domain information to infer activity and talk in general terms to founders.<p>If we can do this, we can start to get absolutely solid numbers on whether survivor bias is really a thing. Like, are their explanatory factors as to why Company A did well and not B, or was it just A was lucky? Because if B won because they took VC or because they launched earlier or whatever it is, then we can start to say - survivor bias isn&#x27;t really a thing, because the best funded or quickest company wins. And here&#x27;s the best strategy.<p>This data would seem so valuable to VCs and founders that you&#x27;d think you could make money from it.<p>And then we could put an end to &quot;survivor bias&quot; as an argument - which presumably would be the outcome (ah confirmation bias! i can&#x27;t be that scientist) because otherwise it&#x27;s disproportionately luck and we can all go home now.",entertainment,sports,

974,"&gt; but we shouldn&#x27;t forget survivor bias here<p>Hi HN, entrepreneurial scientist here. You have just given me an idea. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be posting this buried in the comments but can always be reposted elsewhere.<p>&quot;survivor bias&quot;<p>This is a constant talking point in HN. It allows anyone to plausibly dismiss absolutely any advice from a successful entrepreneur (no offence to the poster here intended, they may be right - it&#x27;s just that it can be used anywhere).<p>It&#x27;s so powerful, in fact, that the only plausible retort is to look to serial successful entrepreneurs - Jobs, Musk etc. - as evidence that it&#x27;s at least not entirely luck that leads to success. And even that counterargument is on shaky ground.<p>So what we need to do is to get more scientific. We need to know how many other startups were formed in that area, or with that idea, or just in general. I think this is totally doable. What we need is a bad ass business scientist in some university to take on this challenge. Actually, hell - this is a startup idea in itself. So it probably exists somewhere.<p>I would begin by monitoring all new company registrations in my home country (UK) and keeping a look out for tech startups. You can check their websites at regular intervals, look at Companies House metadata, and scrape news to classify them correctly. Monitor accounts returns to see when&#x2F;if they trade, and fold. Although it&#x27;d take time to build the database, after a year I think you&#x27;d already have interesting observations.<p>You could also do phone interviews with (a sample of?) founders. The goal would be to get them to almost &quot;register&quot; themselves in the same way as a medical trial might be registered. You&#x27;ll definitely have a problem with confidentiality, so you may need to delay the release of data by 10 years, or to release only aggregate data, or else to rely only on aggregating public domain information to infer activity and talk in general terms to founders.<p>Other sources of data: incubator batches, demo days, product hunt, advertisements placed by the startups, job adverts. I&#x27;d also do &quot;exit interviews&quot; with founders that are no longer registered as directors at Companies House, or when their companies cease trading.<p>If we can do this, we can start to get absolutely solid numbers on whether survivor bias is really a thing. Like, are their explanatory factors as to why Company A did well and not B, or was it just A was lucky? Because if B won because they took VC or because they launched earlier or whatever it is, then we can start to say - survivor bias isn&#x27;t really a thing, because the best funded or quickest company wins. And here&#x27;s the best strategy.<p>This data would seem so valuable to VCs and founders that you&#x27;d think you could make money from it.<p>And then we could put an end to &quot;survivor bias&quot; as an argument - which presumably would be the outcome (ah confirmation bias! i can&#x27;t be that scientist) because otherwise it&#x27;s disproportionately luck and we can all go home now.",technology,sports,

I&#x27;m professional, I had worked Hollywood for long enough to know of his type (first time experiencing anything like that though) so I remained calm and treated this like a test and said &quot;no problem, never happened.&quot;<p>The story made its way around the office and people simultaneously joked about it while saying they were sorry about the experience too, and echoed my manager&#x27;s advice to leave him alone.  Fast forward about a year and one day he was gone.  No one talked about it.  I&#x27;m guessing the company finally got enough on him to terminate without worry of blowback.  He was a partner and probably had a decent contract in place.<p>Now, something like 5 years after that (I had moved on to greener pastures) I was out front of a community volunteer bike shop chatting with the team.

It caught everybody off guard, but it lead to pretty fun night, nonetheless.

I have zero issues with it and no amount of &quot;but they&#x27;re living things and so cute&quot; is going to change that fact.<p>It&#x27;s exactly this type of nonsense that gets people to turn away from meat like products.  We don&#x27;t need a lecture about sad little animals every time we order a delicious smash burger.,science,science,

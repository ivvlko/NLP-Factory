114,"2021-06-11","Launch HN: Slingshow (YC W20) – Easily build custom virtual events and webinars","Hello world, my name is Nilay. My cofounder Jorge and I founded Slingshow (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slingshow.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slingshow.com&#x2F;</a>) and we&#x27;re super excited (and nervous!) to finally launch on HN. Slingshow helps you build custom virtual events for your community. Think Zoom, but with a modern and flexible user experience that seamlessly flows between different ways of interacting with larger and smaller groups.<p>Last year, we were in YC W20 pivoting through several ideas, but then the pandemic hit. Suddenly, our YC batch was just a series of monotonous Zoom calls. We lost the magic of the social dinners, random conversations, and catching a speaker afterward for a personal chat. We quickly recognized that while Zoom was great for small meetings, the functionality and UI&#x2F;UX made large group events unorganized and passive.<p>During the pandemic, many novel and sometimes gimmicky video platforms emerged targeting the social niche. But every organization hosts more than social events. We built Slingshow to have no learning curve for traditional use cases like panels and presentations while seamlessly incorporating newer social formats. We think the best virtual event formats are still in their infancy and are unique to every use case, so we wanted to create a flexible tool that would let organizers build their own experiences.<p>We were inspired by companies like Notion, Coda, Retool, and Airtable, which work in the UI&#x2F;UX paradigm of creating functional modular building blocks. This means choosing a few simple, valuable abstractions like a table or a button and letting users mix and match these components to meet their needs. In our case, we’re starting with four fundamental blocks that organizers use to plan a schedule: Tables for free-flowing networking like interactions, Rooms for concurrent presentations, a Stage for classic webinar like presentations, and a Call to Action block for redirecting to external websites like forms, activities, etc.<p>Using our blocks, one of our enterprise customers (Fivetran) holds their standard webinar on our Stage block and then shifts into the Rooms block where attendees can choose to speak with the panelists. Another customer held a dating event that started with a Stage to introduce the event, then switched to Tables of 4, then 3, then 2 with different prompts to create more intimate conversations. We also have other customers hosting unique product launches, happy hours, live podcasts, cohort-based classes, and multi-day hackathons. While some platforms offer similar functionality, they’re heavy conference platforms with a large learning curve. They also require days of work to create specialized assets and often involve trained intermediaries like event organizers and planners.<p>We’re not focused on conferences but rather on simplicity, and Blocks help us achieve that. They&#x27;re versatile and help simplify the organizer&#x27;s event creation process by hiding complexity. Blocks are also a simple way for us to add new formats in the future. By just by creating a schedule with Blocks, Slingshow automatically generates the event page with registration, a cover image, and the entire attendee experience. Add a logo and brand color, and we&#x27;ll automatically theme the entire event to make it feel like your brand.<p>We&#x27;ve chosen to launch late as nothing else matters if the video isn&#x27;t stable and reliable for first-time users. One speaker failing to connect could ruin an event leaving a bad impression on everyone involved. We’ve spent several months working with early customers to gracefully handle errors and give helpful error messages for all the complexity of video: weak network connections, old browsers, mobile devices, firewalls, SDK edge cases, permission issues, etc. Depending on the use case, we also switch between multiple WebRTC video infrastructure providers. And lastly, following the lead of companies like Discord and Tandem, we built our backend using the Phoenix framework in Elixir because of its excellent support for WebSockets.<p>We still have a long way to go, but we feel confident with what we have and are ready to open up to a broader audience. We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and experiences with the many virtual events you&#x27;ve probably experienced over this pandemic. Thanks! :–)<p>You can try out Slingshow for free here – <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slingshow.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slingshow.com&#x2F;</a>.","web/mobile","web/mobile","general"

We’re a cataract surgeon and software engineer duo who are spearheading the at-home eyecare revolution. Our goal is to provide comprehensive eyecare to people at home, and as a first step, we&#x27;re tackling online glasses&#x2F;contact lens prescriptions renewals.<p>I (Quinn) started the company after I took care of a grandfather who tragically went blind during the Covid lockdown. This could have been prevented if he had had access to reliable at-home eyecare. During my training, I had seen countless similar scenarios play out around the country, but to have it happen in my own clinic was the last straw.<p>Eyecare is a weird and tricky space. On the one hand, there are legitimate reasons why eye doctors and their patients are tied to a physical office, and they mostly center on bulky hardware limitations (e.g. the slit lamp biomicroscope.) On the other hand, there are actually few legitimate reasons healthy people without eye disease need to be making routine in-office visits. In fact, the American Association of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends that folks with healthy eyes, good vision, and no risk factors for eye disease get a comprehensive exam just once in their 20s and twice in their 30s.<p>With this context, it’s absolutely wild that while millions of people are overexposed to eyecare via unnecessary pupillary dilations and air puff tests (which by the way are wildly inaccurate,) millions more can’t access even basic eyecare services, including refractions (aka the measurement of one’s eye prescription.) After all, 24% of U.S. counties have no optometrists or ophthalmologists!<p>Online eye exams are a first step toward addressing this pervasive access and resource allocation problem. We’re building our own version (feel free to play around with the prototype but please <i>access via deskop&#x2F;laptop only</i>: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.quadranteye.com&#x2F;va&#x2F;creditcard"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.quadranteye.com&#x2F;va&#x2F;creditcard</a>) which is an asynchronous exam that assesses your vision and eye health; the exam results, along with a glasses&#x2F;contact lens prescription uploaded by the patient, always get reviewed by an offsite MD&#x2F;OD. Our online exam is live and we&#x27;ve been renewing prescriptions for a few weeks now!<p>Unfortunately, online eye exams are limited in their scope and utility -- for one, they are unable to measure essential eye vitals such as pupillary response and eye pressure. These exams also happen to be extremely controversial, especially since they disrupt the traditional &quot;go into the eye doctor&#x27;s office, renew your prescription, buy your glasses&#x2F;contacts from your eye doctor&quot; model. For evidence that the $18B domestic optical industry stirs up strong emotions, check out this previous HN thread: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21653437"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21653437</a> (and dang tells us there have been many others!)<p>We believe online eye exams are a good catalyst for change, but they are definitely just a stepping stone. We’ve got our eyes on a much bigger vision — true at-home eyecare, including the ability to measure eye vitals — and we’re excited to have everyone follow along!<p>Thanks for reading and see you in the comments below. :)<p>Cheers,

We are building a recommender system. I see 2 options for creating training dataset(joining with ground truth labels). I would like to get feedback from developers regarding usage of Feature Store in this regard.<p>Option 1:<p>1) We can log all the features from prediction API. 
UniqueResponseId, feature1, feature 2 
We can pass UniqueResponseId in response and then it would be logged when customers take action to this response. 
UniqueResponseId, response1.<p>Then we can join these 2 data to form training dataset, 
UniqueResponseId, feature1, feature2, ..., action1 .<p>This approach seems like perfect as we are able to get exact features and their corresponding actions.<p>Option 2:
We can have time travel in Feature Store. Time travel allows to get features at certain point of time. 
The approach would be:
We log, 
responseId, time1 from prediction API. 
When customer takes action, we log
responseId, action1<p>Then we do: 
getTime(responseId) returns time1
getFeatures(time1) ==&gt; return feature 0, feature 1
join on responseId
responseId, feature0, feature1, action1<p>This approach is complex and there are other disadvantages if features are changing rapidly as  it is impossible to get exact features used during serving. The features can only be approximated in this option.<p>I am unsure if I should go with Option 2. Option1 seems like intuitive choice.
I would like to learn from other people experience if there are other approaches or if I am missing anything here.","web/mobile","finance","web/mobile"

27,"2021-06-08","Launch HN: Runway (YC W21) – Easier iOS and Android app releases for teams","Hi HN!<p>I’m Gabriel, one of the co-founders of Runway (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runway.team"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runway.team</a>). We’re building a SaaS platform that makes it easier to coordinate your team’s mobile app releases. Runway is an integration layer that sits on top of mobile app teams’ existing project management and development tools, making it possible to understand at-a-glance the status and progress of release cycles and to communicate tasks and blockers — allowing teams to spend their time on improving their product instead of managing releases and tooling.<p>When I was an iOS engineer, my team rotated everyone through the release manager role for each release cycle. I remember dreading the weeks I was assigned this role - I’d get stuck spending a few hours with multiple Chrome tabs open checking on the status of different tools, killing time while waiting for builds to upload, Slacking the owners of various tasks, and referring back to a 40-line spreadsheet that was often out of date. . I also felt out of practice each time it was my turn - it was hard to remember the sequence of stuff that needed doing, and there weren’t any guardrails to guide me through the process again. New additions to the team felt even more lost when it was their first couple of turns in the role!<p>If anything, the problem has worsened over time as mobile apps became first-class platforms at lots of companies, and tech orgs naturally started to grow those development teams and implement more robust and complex toolchains to support them — but much of the process of coordinating those people and tools in order to release regularly has remained frustratingly ad hoc.<p>While some build-centric tasks can be automated (e.g. using fastlane or scripts), we see that a lot of the overhead of releases is actually very people-centric: keeping your PM up to date on progress, looping in marketing for release notes, or syncing with QA on the status of regression testing. We also noticed that, even with a solid CI&#x2F;CD pipeline in place, there are often still lots of manual tasks along the way - build selection, branching and tagging, compiling changelogs, pinging the right people with status and updates, etc.<p>We built Runway to connect all those dots. It pulls in all Jira tickets and code relevant to the release, side-by-side, to surface and resolve any out-of-sync tickets or code. You can set up custom, interactive checklists with item-specific owners to replace the monster Google spreadsheet, and our Slack integration will ping the appropriate people or notify everyone when important milestones happen. Design&#x2F;marketing can enter ‘What’s New’ release notes directly in Runway for all localizations (with a handy list of new features in the release to reference) without you having to hunt them down. Plus, Runway helps teams maintain good workflow hygiene by automatically tagging releases in GitHub and applying missing labels to Jira tickets.<p>Typically, tasks like these represent lost time that adds up quickly and silently for teams and release managers, between context-switching, monitoring jobs for completion and waiting to get someone’s attention on Slack (all of which only gets harder as teams become more distributed with remote work). In talking to lots of companies, we’ve also noticed that some larger orgs eventually try to build something like Runway in-house, but at a steep cost of dedicated engineers, time, and recurring maintenance.<p>Runway is made for any team building and shipping mobile apps – we currently support both iOS and Android, and have built-in support for OTA (over-the-air) deploys as well as SDK releases. And, we’re language and framework agnostic: whether you write in Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java, or use a framework like React Native, Expo, or Flutter, Runway has you covered. We envision Runway as a better way for most teams to manage the release process — one that can save an average-sized mobile team releasing bi-weekly about $50K a year.<p>We’re still experimenting with pricing strategy, but for now we’re charging a monthly subscription fee per app – there&#x27;s a lower tier to access most features, and a higher tier with added features is in the works. Currently the product is in private beta, but we’re actively onboarding new teams of all sizes. If you and your team are interested in trying Runway out, head to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runway.team&#x2F;demo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runway.team&#x2F;demo</a> for a detailed demo video and we’ll get you onboarded right away!<p>There are lots of possibilities for further automation and intelligent monitoring on a platform that serves as the glue between the pieces of a release workflow, and we’re excited to hear from the HN community about their unique release process challenges (and general thoughts as well!)","web/mobile","web/mobile","web/mobile"

One might wonder, why is all this fluffy stuff with variable names necessary?
Here is the story how I came up with the prompt above.
I first tried to do the same without these variables, and it fails, and I think I know why.<p>It fails to add the penultimate element (the 9th element of a list of 10 elements), constantly. When I click it, I see its probability was 40% and the probability of last was 60% roughly. It&#x27;s very similar to how we humans reasons when we are told a list of 10 numbers. We remember the first ones (a sequence) the last one (because being the last is an event), but we might forget about some elements in between, or think we have to finish the computation quickly.
I thought, how do we humans augment our memory abilities, like to remember 100 items? From experimenting it myself, I knew that associative memories augment the capacity to remember things. For example, to remember 100 items, I can think of walking through a place of 100 rooms I know, and imagine an item in each room.
What would be the equivalent for GPT-3? Associate the numbers to add with something else. I thought, let&#x27;s put variable names.","web/mobile","finance","AI/Data Science"

Instead, you must specify a search term and run the search. i.e. There is no way to simply see what&#x27;s going on in town and randomly pick a local event to go to.<p>* Time-Based Search Criteria: Users are unable to for an event that occurs at a specific time. E.g. &quot;Show me events that start at 6pm and end by 10pm.&quot;<p>* Nearby Cities: Results will often display events in nearby cities, despite the User specifying that they only want to see &quot;nearby events&quot;. This makes the search results essentially unusable, since much of what is displayed is not appropriate to you.<p>...and yet, FB events are often the only game in town.<p>Honestly, I am quite suspicious of Facebook&#x27;s reasons for making these UI and UX decisions, since no self-respecting UI&#x2F;UX designer would come up with this interface or this experience. Maybe Facebook believes that if you&#x27;re attending in-person events, then you aren&#x27;t using Facebook?<p>I would truly love to see FB improve the UI and UX of the Events API so that Users could find more appropriate results for their searches.","web/mobile","general","web/mobile"

We&#x27;re Taylor, Colton, and Jason, the founders of Hedgehog (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hedgehog.app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hedgehog.app</a>). We&#x27;re building a portfolio manager to help you learn about, keep track of, and trade cryptocurrency in one place.<p>We track 2000+ actively traded currencies across 550+ wallets, aggregate data from 20 different providers, and support trading on 130+ exchanges. This helps users make informed choices about investments and find the best prices across exchanges, with price differences as high as 0.5%. We also combine live usage data with detailed research on how each coin works, so you can see for yourself why a coin could be valuable--or not.<p>We know that HN tends to be divided on cryptocurrency-related topics, with some people interested and involved and others skeptical or critical. Obviously we find ourselves in the prior camp, but we also completely agree that the excessive hype and outright scams are a problem. Somebody has already created a scam token with our name on it!<p>As early team members at Acorns (the mobile app that invests your spare change), we helped simplify traditional investing and hope to bring that same level of transparency, clarity, and rigor to cryptocurrency.<p>We first got into this space in 2017. We were running a small consulting agency when three of our clients broke their contracts in the same month: one went bankrupt, one got sued by an ex-partner, and one was based in Alabama and decided that because we were in California they simply didn&#x27;t have to pay us. We lost $30k that month.<p>That&#x27;s when we learned about Ethereum and smart contracts, and a light bulb went off. Price and volatility aside, if we simply could have used a smart contract where money is automatically deposited upon project completion, we would have ensured payment.<p>But getting into cryptocurrency is complicated, painful, and it leaves new users particularly vulnerable. Taylor once spent $20k worth of ETH on fees, simply because of a bad interface. Add in secret keys and exchange hacks and you quickly find yourself in chaos. And yet, over half of cryptocurrency owners report that it was their very first investment, ever--and their most commonly used tracking tool is Excel.<p>That’s why we built Hedgehog, to give you fine-tuned control over your portfolio: our average client trades on at least 3 exchange accounts and automatically syncs balances across more than 10 different wallets. You can also group your assets into stacks like “Banking” or “Ethereum Tokens”, apply investing strategies, and even set up a rebalance calculator to help you distribute your funds based on live metrics like market cap, daily active addresses, or transaction volume.<p>We&#x27;re already helping individuals and investment firms manage $40 million in cryptocurrency, and we are acquiring the necessary financial licenses to offer a custodial wallet that connects users directly with the best price. You will no longer need to connect your own exchanges and wallets, we’ll manage multiple currencies across multiple exchanges for you. This allows us to earn revenue by making our own markets and keeping some of the difference between prices offered by buyers and sellers.<p>Love it or hate it, the fact that there&#x27;s over $48 trillion in annual cryptocurrency exchange volume at this point makes it unlikely to go away, and there&#x27;s a ton of work to be done in wrangling it into some sort of level playing field that makes sense to people.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear what you think, even if it’s just “this market shouldn’t exist in the first place.” If you&#x27;re active in cryptocurrency (or want to be), we&#x27;d love to have you as a user and are dying to ship features you want.

15,"2021-06-07","Show HN: One flew over the variadic template arguments","Python is a dynamically -- run-time -- typed language. That creates big advantages and big disadvantages. The advantage: it makes it very versatile and heterogeneously functional. For example, you could easily have heterogeneous containers. You could easily loop through them and your loop variable is dynamically evaluated. Also, you could have heterogeneous interfaces, …
The disadvantage: it is very inefficient. For example, in the above loop, the loop variable type must be determined at each iteration. That’s extremely inefficient -- although there are ways under certain circumstances to avoid that.<p>C++, on the other hand, is statically and moderately-strongly typed language. So, you cannot – without using pointers which is inefficient – have heterogeneous containers because you must know all types at compile time. Also, you cannot have heterogeneous interfaces, …
Enter the _ variadic template arguments_. This modern C++ feature makes it possible to have some aspects of heterogeneity without the disadvantage of inefficiency. Variadic template arguments help in designing interfaces for heterogeneous containers. 
As an example, please look at [DataFrame](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hosseinmoein&#x2F;DataFrame) which implements a C++ heterogeneous container. Look at member methods load_data()(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmlpreview.github.io&#x2F;?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hosseinmoein&#x2F;DataFrame&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;load_data.html), groupby()(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmlpreview.github.io&#x2F;?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hosseinmoein&#x2F;DataFrame&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;groupby.html), bucketize()(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmlpreview.github.io&#x2F;?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hosseinmoein&#x2F;DataFrame&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;bucketize.html).

I announced this first on HN a few months ago that got a bunch of interest. It has grown a lot since then: I’ve made many improvements, added paid subscriptions, and the app hit 100k+ downloads on Android recently. There’s a growing list of subscribers supporting development.<p>This started as a iOS app to build what I personally wanted for these reasons:<p>* There are many tools for complex note taking and project organization, but they don’t make it easy for quickly noting down thoughts. I wanted a fast way to write something down, and an interface like chat seemed most appropriate. I’ve seen many people use chat apps to achieve these things in roundabout ways but they don’t support everything I wanted.<p>* Keeping track of things over time isn’t easy in other note-taking apps. InstaNote has threads and I personally use them to track my weight and pictures over time. Super easy to see trends.<p>* Most tools don’t have the flexibility of reminders that I wanted. InstaNote has one-time reminders + reminders repeating daily, weekly, monthly, with multiple snooze options. I have 10+ repeating reminders set for myself (this surprised me too!). All reminders can be ported to a new device when you login with one click.<p>* Everyone saves a ton of links. Without link previews (like those shown in chat apps), saved links are really hard to browse and find. InstaNote shows link previews which make browsing and searching a lot easier.<p>* Sharing notes also works great in a chat-like UI.<p>* CSV copy of notes: Subscribers get a CSV copy of their notes on email with one click in the app (available on Android, upcoming on iOS but emailing support@instanote.io will work in the meantime). I want users to use the product because they find it useful, not because their data is locked in.<p>Many app subscribers have given great feedback over the last couple of months.

The obvious .com domain name, while available, would have been unwieldy to type in an email. The owner often abbreviated the company&#x27;s name with three letters, and wondered if we could have the three-letter domain &quot;.com.&quot; Of course, that domain was already in use, to which he asked, &quot;can we have it too?&quot;<p>I asked what he wanted people to see when they typed in the web address. On the one hand, every millennial has stories of explaining how the internet works to impatient, older people. He was especially scandalized (and I don&#x27;t think he fully believed me) when he learned what registered domain names generally cost. Remembering that conversation now has me thinking... the internet is a weird place full of ad-hoc cooperative arrangements. In the age of JSON-LD schemas, well-known URLs, and EXTERNAL SENDER warnings, perhaps no corporation with a significant digital strategy will stomach sharing a domain. But do any of you know of examples of domain sharing among smaller firms? Does anybody make it work? How did the arrangement come about?","web/mobile","job/career","web/mobile"

This seemed to be kind of a personal &quot;trademark&quot; and he had apparently looked that way for some years already.<p>As part of his speech, maybe a speech about math and programming or math and Python, he told a personal anecdote that goes roughly like this:<p>He used to teach on a reservation and he lent a math book of his own to a Native teenage boy and the boy got beat up real bad and quit school, apparently over having accepted the math book from a White man and taken it home to read it. The boy returned the book to him at some point.<p>Years later, he noticed funny stuff in the margins and was able to identify it as the boy&#x27;s Native language and found a way to translate it and the boy was grateful for having read the book in spite of the high price he had paid for doing so.<p>I think the Native boy referred to the speaker telling this story as something like &quot;Two Beards&quot; in his notes in the book.<p>This may have been a keynote speech.<p>I spent maybe an hour looking for it last night and I&#x27;m stumped.

207,"2021-06-16","Launch HN: Svix (YC W21) – Webhooks as a Service","Hey everyone, my name is Tom, and I&#x27;m the founder of Svix (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svix.com</a>) - previously known as Diahook. Svix makes it easy for developers to send webhooks from their service using a simple API. Think Twilio or SendGrid but for webhooks.<p>Webhooks are how servers notify each other of events, so they are a key component of many APIs such as Stripe, Shopify, Slack, Dropbox and Github.
They look easy to implement (just a POST request), but they come with a variety of challenges. For example, customer endpoints fail or hang much more often than you would think, so you would need to implement retries. You need to make sure such failures don&#x27;t clog your send queue or the rest of your system. The webhook system is an additional system separate from your normal web server that needs to be scaled and monitored separately. There are also a variety of security implications such as SSRF, replay attacks, and attackers sending fake webhooks to your customers (so make sure to sign the payload and make it easy to verify!). You also want to avoid overloading your users&#x27; endpoints, so you want to automatically rate-limit webhook sending, as well as disabling failing ones, and notifying your users when you do.<p>I encountered these challenges at my previous company. Our users were constantly asking us for webhooks, but we kept deferring building them because we weren&#x27;t willing to commit the engineering time, resources, and ongoing maintenance required of a webhook delivery system. This was the seed for Svix, but it&#x27;s only after a friend of mine asked about adding webhooks to her own product that I realized &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s maybe a business here&quot;.<p>The idea behind Svix is to make it very easy for everyone to send webhooks. Developers make one API call and we take care of deliverability, monitoring, and retries.
We also have a pre-built management UI that our customers can offer their users to manage their webhook endpoints, as well as inspect, debug, and replay failures.
This is in addition to a variety of tools, libraries, and tutorials to make both sending and consuming webhooks easy.<p>We have previously done a Show HN (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26399672"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26399672</a>) and got a lot of great feedback from the community.
A lot has changed since then, for example, we now have libraries for Python, JavaScript (TypeScript), Java and Go; a first version of the Ruby and PHP libraries, and a CLI for interacting with the service.
We have improved the management UI, made it easy to embed it in an iframe, and improved the onboarding and documentation to make it even easier to get started.
And finally, we have scaled the backend to keep up with the growing needs of our customers.
We have a lot more planned for the coming months, and we&#x27;ve grown the team so improvements are going to come at an even higher pace.<p>One of the common questions from our Show HN was: &quot;Don&#x27;t developers need to handle deliverability and retries to Svix?&quot;
Deliverability to user endpoints (servers) is very different to deliverability to Svix.
User endpoints fail all the time and for various reasons, and each of them can fail independently.
This means developers need a robust and scalable delivery system that can deal with failures on an ongoing basis.
While with Svix, outages are rare, and are dealt with as incidents. The same way you would with SendGrid, Twilio and other API providers.<p>Our goal with Svix is to make it easier for developers to add webhooks to their service. Webhooks make APIs that much more useful and enable a lot of automations and integrations which benefit both the products offering them, and the communities around them. Just think of all the cool Slack bots made possible thanks to webhooks. I&#x27;d really love to see every service out there offering a great API!<p>I&#x27;d love to hear about your experience building (or using) webhooks systems. What&#x27;s a must have?

175,"2021-06-14","Launch HN: Revery.AI (YC S21) Scalable deep learning-based virtual dressing room","Hi HN! We are Kedan, Jeff, and Min Jin and we are co-founders of Revery AI. We&#x27;ve built a virtual dressing room for online retailers that allows customers to visualize any combination of garments on any model.<p>The rise of online shopping has posed significant challenges for fashion retailers. The lack of ability to try on and visualize outfits has made shopping less interactive, contributing to low conversion rates and high return rates compared to brick-and-mortar shopping. Virtual dressing rooms can recreate the lost experience of trying on clothes in person. There are other companies working on a virtual dressing room. However, the reason why this is not taking off is scalability. Fashion ecommerce platforms have thousands, if not millions of SKUs. Current approaches generally require custom Photoshop work or expensive 3D models which are difficult to scale. In contrast, our solution leverages our machine learning research to automate the entire process, resulting in the first scalable virtual dressing room that can be easily integrated with any large e-commerce platform with millions of SKUs.<p>Rather than time-consuming 3d modeling, our system works with basic images. The goal, of course, is to produce accurate and realistic visualizations of outfits on people. A naive solution would be to simply copy-paste the garment onto the model. This presents two problems. 1) If the poses of the model&#x2F;garment are mismatched, copy-paste does not work. 2) Even with ideal poses, copy-paste does not take into account garment-garment, garment-model interactions and also ignores lighting, shadows, etc. We use deep learning to overcome this problem. For problem 1) we use a series of image warpers to warp the garment onto an approximate body location in the appropriate pose. This differs from current approaches that typically use only a single warp which is extremely limited. For 2) we train an image generator that takes in relevant inputs (includes the model image, garment image, pose, etc) and produces a realistic image of the model wearing the garment. Our system produces significant improvements in size, fit, and drape compared to prior art, allowing us to create realistic images of any model wearing any combination of garments. If anyone is interested in additional details, we published an earlier version of our system here <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2003.10817"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2003.10817</a>. We also have another paper that will appear in the CVPR2021 conference soon.<p>This approach makes integration with retailers far easier because it requires only a single garment image on a uniform background per SKU. Upon receiving their catalog, our team processes them at a rate of 1 million images per week. We then work with the retailer to create a widget that can be easily injected into their website. The simplicity of this solution means that clients can have a virtual dressing room live in as quick as a few days. A live demo can be viewed here:<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revery.ai&#x2F;demo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revery.ai&#x2F;demo.html</a>.<p>We’ve successfully integrated with several fashion e-commerce retailers. Through working with our clients, we’ve shown that our dressing room improves the average engagement of users by 6x and, more importantly, the conversion rate by 6x. Additionally, we’ve seen increases in average order value (AOV) and decreases in return rates. Our solution also presents several use cases beyond the virtual dressing room. Because image generation is at the heart of our business, clients have also expressed interest in using our services to generate photoshoot images to forgo expensive studio photography.<p>Funnily enough, we have never envisioned ourselves doing a start-up in the fashion space as our backgrounds are all in computer science and research. We are all computer vision Ph.D. students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and virtual try-on was initially just an academic pursuit. Kedan was researching fashion AI applications such as product recommendation while Min Jin was working on image generation and manipulation. Jeff was working on applied machine learning to practical problems like medicine and image search. We quickly realized that our individual expertise was compatible in tackling this difficult yet exciting problem. While image-based virtual try-on is an active research field in academia, no one has yet been able to productionize this technology. The transition from research to product is non-trivial - published research often operates on a largely simplified version of the problem. Generating realistic and accurate high-fidelity images of people and clothing is harder than it sounds. Inaccuracies are simply unacceptable for customers. People will not be happy if their miniskirt turns out to be a long skirt! It took us a year to get satisfactory results and at that point, we realized that this academic exercise can actually be a tool that real users want to use. That’s when we decided to launch Revery AI to bring a virtual dressing room shopping experience to all shoppers and retailers.<p>We would love to hear any feedback or answer any questions!","AI/Data Science","finance","AI/Data Science"

I know this use case might not be applicable to many activities, but I think it would work great for some.<p>For example, a tennis pro could create a schedule of time slots that they are available to teach. A person would sign up for a lesson time slot. If they realized that they needed a different time slot but the schedule was full, they could post a message to the &quot;program&quot; participants (program could be all users in that tennis pro&#x27;s schedule for the same day or next few days). This would save the pro time from contacting everyone to try to find a person to switch times and reschedule.","web/mobile","devops/OS","web/mobile"

71,"2021-06-10","Launch HN: Okay (YC W20) – Analytics for engineering teams","Antoine and Tomas here - we are excited to share Okay (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okayhq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okayhq.com</a>) with you! Okay is an engineering analytics platform focused on detecting bottlenecks and annoyances that prevent engineering teams from being fully productive. We connect with all the devtools in your company and give you a query and alerting engine to find and solve common bottlenecks like long review cycles, after-hours on-call pages, heavy interview load, etc. Think Datadog or Grafana, but for team analytics.<p>For the past 12 years, we’ve been engineers and then managers of teams of 5 to 150 in several types of companies - startups and big tech. We’ve seen the dev experience being affected by the same problems everywhere: maybe it’s a slow build on your local machine, too many meetings and interviews, or inefficient code review practices that force you to open 10 PRs in parallel to make progress on a given week. We personally struggled with automated tests suites that would take 4 hours to complete and we saw teammates become so desensitized to heavy oncall load that they would stop complaining and just give up.<p>We also learned that the discussion about engineering metrics always falls into a false dichotomy: don’t measure anything because engineering is creative work (it is!) or measure engineers in intrusive ways along meaningless dimensions like lines of code. We believe that the way to overcome this false dichotomy is to apply quantitative measurements <i>empathetically</i>, that is, with a clear understanding of the human impacts of what&#x27;s being measured on the people doing the actual work - for example, by measuring how noisy on-call pages disrupt an engineer’s life after hours. The key is to focus on bottlenecks instead of output, and on the team level rather than on individuals. So we set out to build a product where you can see all the data from all your dev tools, query it, make sense of trends, and build alerts for when things go wrong.<p>At its core, Okay is an end-to-end analytics platform focused on engineering data. First, we ingest data from tools like Google Calendar, Github, Pagerduty, etc. We join it with the team structure that we find in services like Workday. In addition to pre-built integrations, you can also use a tracing-like API to capture e.g. how long local builds are taking. Then, we clean up and enrich the signal: tagging interviews correctly, rebuilding the full history of a PR as a connected chain of review events, inferring dimensions like tenure (which can e.g. help capture new hire experience). Finally, we expose all this data in a query builder UI that closely maps to the underlying SQL query, and we enable users to choose from visualizations we built specifically for representing engineering work: time series of course, but also calendars (e.g. to understand the life of a PR) or heatmaps (e.g. to identify a painful on-call rotation quickly). The opinionated part of Okay is all in the data modeling we do on behalf of users - we aim to reflect our values (team-based vs individuals) and to retain a lot of expressiveness so that users can ask questions like “what is the code review experience of our new hires in our NYC office compared to the SF office?”.<p>You can check how Okay works by going to our website (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okayhq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okayhq.com</a>) or checking our product video (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jzzo3m4280k"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jzzo3m4280k</a>). We don’t have free trials because once you identify bottlenecks and set the right alerts to create new habits, it usually takes several weeks to see the changes happen - we’re talking about humans working together after all, so it does require a little bit of upfront investment. We price based on the number of users and engineers on the team.<p>If you are interested or have specific questions for your use-case, we’d love to connect with your team directly in the comments.

186,"2021-06-15","Launch HN: Axolo (YC W21) – Faster pull requests and code reviews","Hi HN!<p>We’re Arthur and Sydney (cosydney). We’re building Axolo (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axolo.co"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axolo.co</a>) a bidirectional Github-Slack integration to help tech teams reduce pull request time and improve code review’s feedback.<p>Sydney and I met in 42, a software engineering school in Paris, and started working together on different tech projects last year. While working on our last business, a SaaS management platform for SMEs, we were in a squad of 4 to 5 people and often found ourselves writing direct messages in Slack about pull requests. We were telling each other things like ‘Hey Arthur, I’ve updated my last pull request feature&#x2F;zoom_integration, do you have time to check it out soon?’ or “it’s been two days, do you have time to review feature&#x2F;user_settings today, here is the link: github&#x2F;axolo-co&#x2F;api.axolo.co&#x2F;pull&#x2F;381?”. It was messy, took time and mental load to contextualize each pull request to each other.<p>We talked to over 100 companies about how they ship code. Here is the most common pattern:  An engineer creates a pull request and asks someone or a dedicated team to review it. Notifications are poorly handled and people often ping again directly. Then, comments are made on Github and if a disagreement appears, the conversation goes on a voice call or in Slack.<p>This approach has two major problems. (1) Dangling pull requests are waste of time and a source of frustration for developers. They cause the code development process to slow down and prevent developers from focusing on a new task ahead. It’s difficult to dive back into a pull request you submitted two days ago. (2) Feedback on code is hard to convey between one developer to another. It can be misinterpreted or even worse: not given at all.<p>The ideal solution doesn’t need a new tool in our daily routine. Having in mind that most of the friction was in context-switching between Github and Slack, we decided to build a bridge between those two.<p>So we developed Axolo as a bi-directional Github-Slack integration. Each pull request creates a temporary Slack channel where Github notifications are sent (comments, reviews, actions &amp; deployments). The creator, reviewers, and assignees are invited to that channel. Then when the pull request is either closed or merged, we save the conversation as documentation in the Github pull request and archive the channel.<p>We&#x27;re not only a code review notification center. We consider each pull request as a small independent project where all people that take a part in it will be invited. Here’s a demo video (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;aoOZNGdBKlY"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;aoOZNGdBKlY</a>) of how it works, if you want to take a glance at our main features.<p>Our public beta started three weeks ago. To sign up on Axolo, you need to install our Github app on your organization (we do not have access to your code) and our Slack app. Most of our features are free for everyone, but if you’re looking for specific settings &amp; analytics, the professional plan is 8$&#x2F; engineer &#x2F; month that you can try (you don&#x27;t have to enter a credit card upfront).<p>We know the Hacker News community is full of many engineers with deep experiences in code reviewing (and code shipping!) and we look forward to receiving your feedback on our work.

Even at this earlier stage, the compiler is a joy to use (and I am trying to do as much &quot;dog-fooding&quot; as possible, in parallel to improving the compiler).<p>I want this to be an open-source project but, at the same time, I would like to find out ways to keep working on it and sustain myself and my family.<p>Target audience: By my estimates, this new language may be useful (for research, or at least for teaching) for ~1000 people working in this field (assuming that they will accept some small amount of learning, of course). It might also be relevant to a few HPC hardware-vendors, because I am generating accelerator-aware code from one of the backends -- I am fine if they use my code to showcase their hardware, as long as they give something back :). It might also be interesting for people who are just curious about this field.<p>So, my questions are:<p>(1) What are some possible revenue-streams for supporting the continuous development of a programming language, while keeping it open-source? I think I demonstrated by now that I am willing to work on this for free. However, it would be nice not to worry also about a &quot;real&quot; job.<p>The open-source part is quite important, because (more than funding) I want people to use this language. Also, I hope to attract some developers for things like IDE integration, making amazing (Elm-style) error-messages, etc. I am also doing my best to cover these areas, but worrying about these things is no longer a one-man job.<p>(2) Which open-source license would you recommend in this case?<p>P.S: I plan to submit another message here soon, to announce the official release.","web/mobile","general","job/career"

146,"2021-06-14","Launch HN: Revery.AI (YC S21) Scalable deep learning-based virtual dressing room","Hi HN, we are Kedan, Jeff, and Min Jin and we are co-founders of Revery AI! Together, we built a virtual dressing room for online retailers that allows customers to visualize any combination of garments on any model.<p>The rise of online shopping has posed significant challenges for fashion retailers. The lack of ability to try on and visualize outfits has made shopping less interactive, contributing to low conversion rates and high return rates compared to brick-and-mortar shopping. Virtual dressing rooms can recreate the lost experience of trying on clothes in person. There are other companies working on a virtual dressing room. However, the reason why this is not taking off is scalability. Fashion ecommerce platforms have thousands, if not millions of SKUs. Current approaches generally require custom Photoshop work or expensive 3D models which are difficult to scale. In contrast, our solution leverages our machine learning research to automate the entire process, resulting in the first scalable virtual dressing room that can be easily integrated with any large e-commerce platform with millions of SKUs.<p>Rather than time-consuming 3d modeling, our system works with basic images. The goal, of course, is to produce accurate and realistic visualizations of outfits on people. A naive solution would be to simply copy-paste the garment onto the model. This presents two problems. 1) If the poses of the model&#x2F;garment are mismatched, copy-paste does not work. 2) Even with ideal poses, copy-paste does not take into account garment-garment, garment-model interactions and also ignores lighting, shadows, etc. We use deep learning to overcome this problem. For problem 1) we use a series of image warpers to warp the garment onto an approximate body location in the appropriate pose. This differs from current approaches that typically use only a single warp which is extremely limited. For 2) we train an image generator that takes in relevant inputs (includes the model image, garment image, pose, etc) and produces a realistic image of the model wearing the garment. Our system produces significant improvements in size, fit, and drape compared to prior art, allowing us to create realistic images of any model wearing any combination of garments. If anyone is interested in additional details, we published an earlier version of our system here <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2003.10817"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2003.10817</a>. We also have another paper that will appear in the CVPR2021 conference soon.<p>This approach makes integration with retailers far easier because it requires only a single garment image on a uniform background per SKU. Upon receiving their catalog, our team processes them at a rate of 1 million images per week. We then work with the retailer to create a widget that can be easily injected into their website. The simplicity of this solution means that clients can have a virtual dressing room live in as quick as a few days. A live demo can be viewed here:<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revery.ai&#x2F;demo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revery.ai&#x2F;demo.html</a>.<p>We’ve successfully integrated with several fashion e-commerce retailers. Through working with our clients, we’ve shown that our dressing room improves the average engagement of users by 6x and, more importantly, the conversion rate by 6x. Additionally, we’ve seen increases in average order value (AOV) and decreases in return rates. Our solution also presents several use cases beyond the virtual dressing room. Because image generation is at the heart of our business, clients have also expressed interest in using our services to generate photoshoot images to forgo expensive studio photography.<p>Funnily enough, we have never envisioned ourselves doing a start-up in the fashion space as our backgrounds are all in computer science and research. We are all computer vision Ph.D. students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and virtual try-on was initially just an academic pursuit. Kedan was researching fashion AI applications such as product recommendation while Min Jin was working on image generation and manipulation. Jeff was working on applied machine learning to practical problems like medicine and image search. We quickly realized that our individual expertise was compatible in tackling this difficult yet exciting problem. While image-based virtual try-on is an active research field in academia, no one has yet been able to productionize this technology. The transition from research to product is non-trivial - published research often operates on a largely simplified version of the problem. Generating realistic and accurate high-fidelity images of people and clothing is harder than it sounds. Inaccuracies are simply unacceptable for customers. People will not be happy if their miniskirt turns out to be a long skirt! It took us a year to get satisfactory results and at that point, we realized that this academic exercise can actually be a tool that real users want to use. That’s when we decided to launch Revery AI to bring a virtual dressing room shopping experience to all shoppers and retailers.<p>We would love to hear any feedback or answer any questions!

I worked with it for a few days and was able to see the first results quite quickly. Shortly after that, I started the service that used the API gateway to accept data and process it through multiple processes using Step Functions. The cost was about 50$-100$ per day. Due to another feature request, from my customer, I extended the Step Function with a waiting loop, which looked ideal in my mind. Unfortunately, my idea turned out to be a big mistake. I built some kind of loop in one of the steps. At the beginning everything looked fine and my workflow worked exactly as it should. I watched the Step Machine for another day. Everything looked good and I took a few days off after a stressful time. However, in my absence the queue kept growing and suddenly I had 1000 tasks running in parallel and the costs shot up to $2000 a day.

So I&#x27;ve been working at this place as a Junior Software Engineer for about two months and it&#x27;s been a great experience. I get to work with very experienced and amazing engineers and I am forced to adapt to best practices and it has improved the quality of my work greatly.. 
But the thing is the pressure is overwhelming. My managers do not give me any pressure and are kind but I still manage to feel this enormous pressure to perform. 
I put in the hours of work and yet I still have nothing substantial to say or show
during standups and when I do manage to get some results and create a PR there&#x27;s always a problem with it. I have three different tickets and I haven&#x27;t managed to get any of them merged but my colleagues who were hired with me are making so much progress and getting PR&#x27;s merged.
I do put in hours but apparently they are not enough and I think I&#x27;m a bit slow. It makes me very anxious. Sometimes I get so anxious that I get scared of my PC. Anytime I see my PC during a break or the weekend my heart beats uncontrollably. 
I love this job. It challenges me to work harder but it&#x27;s getting overwhelming and everyday I have to resist the intense urge to just send a message to my manager that I quit. 
What should I do? How do I cope?","job/career","job/career","job/career"

The first few times were mind-numbing. Gosh, there&#x27;s so much noise in there! . But eventually I became more selective and efficient and it became repeatable.<p>Then I evolved it and added stories from reddit, newsletters that I subscribe to, and some other places. Whilst a portion of the stories are still from HN, it&#x27;s no longer only from there.<p>The criteria is &#x27;What I find interesting&#x27; but, since I&#x27;m a typical HN reader, the interest profile ends up being similar. It&#x27;s mainly tech but with splashes of startups, science, productivity, etc. I omit politics. I also try to omit product&#x2F;press releases, big corp stuff, and stories that would be covered by the mainstream tech press.<p>There is little overlap with other Hacker-News-based newsletters and digests. This is intentional. They cover the top stories from HN. Mine does not. (Maybe there might be one or two &#x27;tier 1&#x27; stories, but the majority are not.)<p>So anyway ... if you&#x27;d like to read interesting stuff (whether or not it was unnoticed by HN) please have a look at <i>Interesting Things</i>. I hope you guys like it and find it ... well ... interesting.<p>I&#x27;m also looking for criticism, feedback and suggestions for improvement.

726,"2021-07-15","Launch HN: Weekday (YC W21) – Hire engineers vouched for by other engineers","Hey HN. We are Amit, Chetan, Anubhav and Hari, the cofounders of Weekday (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weekday.works"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weekday.works</a>). We are building a recruitment platform centered around recommendations. We help companies hire engineers who are vouched for by other engineers.<p>Discovering top talent is challenging. It&#x27;s easy to check for great credentials, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as on-ground reality and achievement. It works the other way, too: someone with credentials may not be a great contributor, and screening for credentials eliminates many contributors who are.<p>Our company is based on the insight that great contributors tend to know other great contributors and are in a position to recommend them. We believe that a network-driven approach can help to discover high-caliber candidates.<p>We chanced upon this idea when we were doing our previous startup where we found it excruciatingly difficult to hire our first engineer. We tried all job boards and tech hiring marketplaces but nothing worked. We asked 50 of our friends if they knew a good engineer for us. Many said that they would recommend someone, but few actually did. We realized that it was because the friction to recommend is too high. Instead, we asked those friends to do a screen-share call and scroll their LinkedIn connections and just tell us which ones they would recommend (it didn&#x27;t matter if they thought they were looking out). This ended up increasing our pipeline multifold and is what gave us the idea to productize the same approach and try to make it work for a global network.<p>In an attempt to productise the same approach of hiring via recommendations, we have built a Chrome extension which removes the friction of coming up with names to refer. We give people a shortlist of people to choose from (based on a matching of roles we have available and your connections’ profiles) and they can recommend anyone they like out of them. They get financial rewards if the people they recommend end up getting interviewed by companies or get hired. Our business model works on a success fee model, we take 15% of annual salary from the company’s side. We pass on a percentage of that finder’s fee to the engineer who recommended them, while also paying if any of your recommended friends get interviews (as we have seen on avg companies take 20 interviews to hire 1 person).<p>We have experienced that in hiring, neither a fully automated nor completely human-driven approach works. Having to only interact with software can be a dehumanizing experience. A fully human-led approach leads to a lot of recruiter spam as every recruiter in their silo tries to reach out to every possible engineer. We believe our approach of hiring based on recommendations leads to a much more targeted matching and gives opportunities to people who otherwise would find it difficult in the current credential-driven job market.<p>We would love to get your feedback on our approach and hear about the problems you have faced while hiring, looking to switch jobs or interacting with recruiters.","web/mobile",NULL,"web/mobile"

So &#x27;enjoying&#x27; a week or more of barely being able to walk the length of the room and unable to get any sleep. As I lie awake at night, constantly fidgeting to try and find a comfortable position to try and doze off, I ask myself:<p>What is the point of severe chronic pain? As in &#x27;why would it have evolved?&#x27;I can see no biological advantage to it.<p>With sudden acute pain there&#x27;s an obvious sense the body is trying to protect itself from injury.<i>&quot;Move hand away from hot thing&quot;, &quot;Move leg away from spiky thing&quot;</i> etc. And with tolerable levels of ongoing chronic pain, the body is again trying to protect itself by reminding us through that ache in a limb [for example], to go easy on that body part, as its still healing from a previous injury. Which all makes perfect sense.<p>But what about higher levels of chronic pain? Anyone who&#x27;s had sciatica will know it can last for weeks and be absolutely agonising for days on end. What evolutionary benefit is my body gaining from that?<p>I can barely walk at the moment which, in our wilder ancestry would make me extremely vulnerable to becoming somebody&#x27;s dinner. I hardly ate for 2 days, when it was at its peak and I&#x27;m hardly getting any sleep at the moment. All of which seems intended to make my body more vulnerable, rather than protect it. [Another example of a similar affliction involving this kind of ongoing agony would be severe toothache].<p>So, again, why has such a setup evolved? Why has evolution ended up with a system whereby a tiny minor injury to an insignificant body part can cause the whole system to almost grind to a halt with unbearable levels of pain that seems unending. When a tolerable ache would serve just as well as a reminder to treat the injured area with caution.<p>Generally interested in reading some scientific theories on this.

166,"2021-06-14","Ask HN: Why does archive.is track who reads submitted content via DNS","Does anyone know why archive.is tracks who has read an article.  If we look at the HTML from archive.is we see they include an image link to a domain name that contains the user&#x27;s IP address.  Popular browsers not only run arbitrary Javascript by default, they also access image links by default.  Thus the archive.is DNS server has a record of every time the page is viewed in one of these browsers (and the domain name is not cached).  This includes the IP address of the person who retrieved the page.<p><pre><code>    &lt;img style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;[ipaddr].[country].ABCD.1234567890.pixel.archive.is&#x2F;x.gif&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
It seems some HN commenters have a preference for sharing links to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is</a> as a way of avoiding Javascript obfuscation of text (so-called &quot;paywalls&quot;).<p>The text being obfuscated is public, available to anyone, not only to subscribers.  It is not password-protected.  The website developer using the &quot;paywall&quot; technique simply tries to annoy the user into subscribing by obfuscating the text using Javascript.  This only works if the user runs Javascript from the website.  Popular browsers, most of them funded by advertising, run arbitrary Javascript by default, however Javascript can be disabled by by anyone by simply changing default settings.  Most users do not change default settings.  Most users use the same small number of popular browsers.<p>When we refrain from running Javascript and accessing image links automatically, the web becomes more readable and less annoying. We can choose a browser that is simpler than the popular ones and does fewer things automatically without user input, e.g., running Javascript and loading images.","web/mobile","finance","web/mobile"

We are Amit, Chetan, Anubhav and Hari, the cofounders of Weekday (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weekday.works"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weekday.works</a>). We are building a recruitment platform centered around recommendations. We help companies hire engineers who are vouched for by other engineers.<p>Discovering top talent is challenging. It&#x27;s easy to check for great credentials, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as on-ground reality and achievement. It works the other way, too: someone with credentials may not be a great contributor, and screening for credentials eliminates many contributors who are.<p>Our company is based on the insight that great contributors tend to know other great contributors and are in a position to recommend them. We believe that a network-driven approach can help to discover high-caliber candidates.<p>We chanced upon this idea when we were doing our previous startup where we found it excruciatingly difficult to hire our first engineer. We tried all job boards and tech hiring marketplaces but nothing worked. We asked 50 of our friends if they knew a good engineer for us. Many said that they would recommend someone, but few actually did. We realized that it was because the friction to recommend is too high. Instead, we asked those friends to do a screen-share call and scroll their LinkedIn connections and just tell us which ones they would recommend. This ended up increasing our pipeline multifold and is what gave us the idea to productize the same approach and try to make it work for a global network.<p>In an attempt to productise the same approach of hiring via recommendations, we have built a Chrome extension which removes the friction of coming up with names to refer. We give people a shortlist of people to choose from (based on a matching of roles we have available and your connections’ profiles) and they can recommend anyone they like out of them. They get financial rewards if the people they recommend end up getting interviewed by companies or get hired. Our business model works on a success fee model, we take 15% of annual salary from the company’s side. We pass on a percentage of that finder’s fee to the engineer who recommended them, while also paying if any of your recommended friends get interviews (as we have seen on avg companies take 20 interviews to hire 1 person).<p>We have experienced that in hiring, neither a fully automated nor completely human-driven approach works. Having to only interact with software can be a dehumanizing experience. A fully human-led approach leads to a lot of recruiter spam as every recruiter in their silo tries to reach out to every possible engineer. We believe our approach of hiring based on recommendations leads to a much more targeted matching and gives opportunities to people who otherwise would find it difficult in the current credential-driven job market.<p>We would love to get your feedback on our approach and hear about the problems you have faced while hiring, looking to switch jobs or interacting with recruiters.","web/mobile","web/mobile","web/mobile"

In companies with perf reviews I get some useful feedback here and there but most of the time it&#x27;s positive, people love to work with me, I do get stuff done if I have to, but as soon as I can get away with doing close to nothing, I&#x27;ll take the chance.

440,"2021-06-26","Will Windows 11 use TPM 2.0 – now required – for TC / DRM?","This is one of the more interesting questions about the Windows 11 release that is not being discussed often enough. TPM 2.0, which is required for Windows 11, is the newest standard of a technology that was developed almost 20 years ago as a means for establishing &quot;Trusted Computing&quot; and enhancing DRM measures (see: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diva-portal.org&#x2F;smash&#x2F;record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A206552&amp;dswid=-5253).<p>Pushing users to enable TPM by default will make it much easier to start marketing something like the Microsoft Store of being capable of TC-enhanced DRM. For example, a year or two after launch, an update could require you to be running Microsoft&#x27;s hypothetical new DRM software in order to run any apps downloaded from the Microsoft Store - enforced using the TPM. The option to disable Trusted Computing might still exist, in this hypothetical, but would prevent you from using most &#x2F; all licensed software. The TPM could also be used to force the devices owner to run certain software desired by the manufacturer or  required by government regulation.<p>This would definitely help Windows market the Microsoft Store to 3rd parties, and is in direct alignment with their originally stated goals for Trusted Computing and DRM, and the original purpose of the TPM.<p>What does Hacker News think? Is this paranoia or is this a realistic direction for Windows to be moving?","devops/OS",NULL,"devops/OS"

A big portion of my job involves being given a research assignment, from which I am expected to distill the essential information, construct models, and deliver a thesis or opinion. Unfortunately I have to be vague due to confidentiality requirements...<p>I&#x27;m really struggling because I find these problems incredibly boring, and I basically cannot make myself sit down and do the work. I try to just stop moving and focus, but I get distracted incredibly easy, always reading the news or browsing HN&#x2F;Reddit. The longest stretch I&#x27;ve been able to work for in the past couple weeks is a half hour. This is contrast to personal projects - when I find something interesting, I can work for 10 hours straight, totally in the zone.<p>This is sending me in a bad spiral. I don&#x27;t get any work done, which makes me unhappy, which makes it harder to get work done, and so it goes.

It was a mistake for many reasons, and I don’t want to repeat it.<p>For now, I’m struggling to find the right way to find the co-founder I need. I’m hesitating between two opposite ways of searching for:
1. Browse people I know (friends, former colleagues, etc.) who would accept to create a startup with me. I trust them with human qualities, but most of the time, they are not the right professional profile for the tasks to be done.
2. Go to speed-dating-like events with strangers to find the right professional profile.

I&#x27;ve been a DevOps consultant for 10+ years but usually prefer AWS due to issues I&#x27;ve had to GCP in the past. But this particular client was using them already, so that&#x27;s what we are going with.<p>This client has an account setup with a few projects running within the free tier. We are now ready to deploy a more mature development environment (Mostly GKE and CloudSQL) that will take us out of the free tier limits. We&#x27;ve added billing information to the account and even made a $500 payment in advance.<p>When trying to deploy however we still hit quota limits. The error gives a URL at which quota limit increases can be requested. When trying to do so however the console gives an error message saying the account is not eligible for a quota limit increase and asks us to contact sales.<p>The sales contact page it gives us has a form, a chatbot and a phone number. Calling the default phone number reveals that it is out of service. The chat bot is broken, and after collecting your contact info it resets and goes blank. The form seems to work but then I never receive the promised case email.<p>We were finally able to get through to a sales or support person in the Philippines after trying the Swiss support number instead of the American one (Which is out of service). That person didn&#x27;t seem to know much but claimed they&#x27;d lifted the quota restriction on the account. Of course they didn&#x27;t, and the issue remains.<p>I&#x27;m worried if we try to start over with a brand new account it will look even more suspicious to Google and we&#x27;ll get perma-banned or something.

400,"2021-06-23","Launch HN: Alpas (YC W21) – Software to find suppliers for industrial parts","Hi HN, we are Nils, Isabel, and Chris - the founders of Alpas ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpas.ai&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpas.ai&#x2F;</a> ). We make it fast and easy for medium to large size manufacturers to find suppliers for industrial parts.<p>Why does this matter? Buyers at manufacturing companies face high pressure to cut costs. Supplier sourcing is still very manual and takes up to 45% of a buyer&#x27;s time. Due to the lack of research time, buyers rarely close deals at optimal conditions. Recently, Covid-19 and material shortages have further accelerated the need for more transparent supply chains.<p>Isabel came across this problem during her work as an investment analyst. She realized that optimizing procurement – the buying of goods and services – is one of the most important ways for industrial firms to save costs: more than 50% of revenue is spent on COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) [1] and sourcing is reported to be the biggest value-driver in procurement [2]. As an investment analyst she was used to a much higher level of data transparency that is available from tools such as Bloomberg or CapitalIQ. Inspired by this, we set out to build a similar experience for buyers at manufacturers.<p>After talking to lots of buyers, we found out just how manual current sourcing processes still are: managing existing suppliers in spreadsheets, web research to find new suppliers, calling and visiting suppliers on the ground. Most buyers simply don’t have the time to do a thorough supplier discovery, let alone gather all key information about them to make informed decisions.<p>Solving this problem requires gathering and analyzing supplier and supply chain data from many sources. Building such a tool represents a massive data challenge: gathering, structuring, and indexing 10B+ parameters of 10M+ suppliers worldwide from 500+ data sources. Our two biggest technical challenges are a) providing a standardized mapping of the supplier’s product portfolios and b) continuously tapping into new data sources which need to be incorporated into our existing pipelines. We use NLP models to extract specific keywords in order to create a list of potential supplier candidates. We match the suppliers to various sources using NER, which allows us to filter down candidates based on specific parameters. The result is a final supplier list with detailed information on company facts, products, financials, and much more.<p>Based on this data, we run sourcing projects with our customers, which means finding suppliers for a specific product &amp; region. Since our launch in January, we have been able to win several Fortune 500 companies, including BASF and ABB, as customers. Using our software, our customers have been able to reduce time &amp; procurement spend significantly. On a recent sourcing project, we helped ABB find new suppliers for a custom lens made out of a special material and even suggested additional suppliers for a different material with similar properties. For this project, we saved ABB 40% in procurement spend and 3 weeks of manual work.<p>Our sales process begins with a demo exploring our tool with a subset of the customer&#x27;s existing suppliers. Customers usually continue with a paid pilot - one sourcing project in a certain region.

From the conception of the idea, building the app, websites, backend and to actually getting users to test the platform.
In this short amount of time, I&#x27;ve done very little in the way of validation other than FB polls and comments in groups.<p><i>So I am turning to you to pull it apart.</i><p>I&#x27;ve only just taken a short breath to consider the next steps and in doing so, I realised that for me, this is not just a throw away hackathon project, that I&#x27;ve potentially stumbled on something that could actually make a difference.<p><i>I need your help!</i><p>I want to know what I&#x27;ve missed and what I need to do _next_ to get https:&#x2F;&#x2F;GreenHabit.app visible to the world.<p>Please visit the site and use the app.  As a short overview the GreenHabit app is a Messenger bot that uses the proven scientific methods of habit change to help its&#x27; users adopt one green habit at a time.  When the habit is achieved the user is granted an embeddable badge they can display on their blog or website.  The habit &#x27;score&#x27; is updated in realtime so for each new habit they adopt their score will grow.  There is also an inbuilt referral system so the score aggregates habits you have influenced in others, in other words for each user or employee you onboard your score will grow by habits they achieve making your individual or your companies&#x27; score a indicator of your green influence.<p>The message is simple:  Start a habit. Save our planet!
* No more waiting for governments, regulators and corporations; 
* Our individual efforts collectively can make a difference;
* Amplify your green habits.<p>For GreenHabit to turn into anything of value it needs mass adoption so I am open your contributions, articles, ideas... Over to you HN:<p>Nathan","web/mobile","finance","web/mobile"

260,"2021-06-18","Ask HN: How to force yourself to spend less time on HN?","This past month or so, my work has shifted to have long periods of being on standby during WFH.  However, I can’t get into reading a book, working on personal programming, or applying to other jobs during the downtime because there is too much likelihood that I’ll be summoned to fill the gaps with activities that require sustained concentration.<p>Enter HN.  Somehow my phone remembered that I created an account a few years back and then never used.  HN became a way to fill time because there was no value lost if I had to step away to do work for a while and totally lost my place.  Unlike Reddit, the discussions here are readable and (occasionally) informative.  The problem arrives when I’ve read the font page for the day and then keep coming back to refresh the page or browse the new queue.<p>I’ve tried deleting the HN icon from Safari’s top sites list (I’m a strict iPhone-only poster here).  That worked for a few days until I started to type in “news.y…” in the address bar manually (and then another HN page ended up in my frequently-visited list).<p>What got me off Reddit was boredom or exhaustion from the repetitive discussions.  The addictive points about HN right now for me are the novelty (I’m still finding interesting discussions and not yet mentally autofilling the expected comments on every post I read) and the civility culture (which means that the arguments aren’t Twitter-tier name-calling, so long as there isn’t someone to show up to rant about the evils of socialism on a tangentially-related thread).<p>If I had better Wi-Fi in my office, I could just blackhole HN from my PiHole.  However, my phone reverts to cellular data most of the workday.<p>Fortunately, this should have a natural conclusion in a couple weeks when my team starts a new project and I can expect to be busy with real work all day instead of staying on standby.","web/mobile","devops/OS","web/mobile"
261,"2021-06-19","The ORM and SQL issue we have","Hello everyone, good morning from the Himalayas.<p>There was a post yesterday about an ORM and there was the obvious debate on why ORMs overall are a bad thing. I had posted that the experience of ORM varies by language. A language needs to support run-time manipulation of the definitions of schema to then allow shuttling of data from native types in that language to SQL.<p>But it does not stop there. If you use a query builder it goes a long way, sure. If  you write SQL, it is a lot worse. What happens when your data is the source of truth for building rich query experience? Say we have 12 types of taxononmy (Size, Region, Price, Supplier, ...) and the user can filter dynamically? Also your environment (where is the user currently querying from) determines the set filters.<p>This is not easy to solve directly with SQL. How do you loop over all the incoming filters? How you extract data coming in from HTTP requests and bind them to an SQL query? Manually write each possible combination? This falls apart quickly and we need a better abstraction for SQL itself, not the underlying data. SQL was created for database users to sit and type out queries. The query parameters were known at the time of typing the SQL. This is mostly NOT how it is used in (backend) applications. SQL is being dynamically generated all the time. So the (backend) application strives to have a complete understanding of the model, relations, data types, constraints.<p>There are other advantages when you have the entire data definition in your programming language: CRUD becomes easier. Migrations also can be written in the programming language instead of SQL, although I have always appreciated writing SQL migrations too.<p>I really hope the community keeps experimenting and trying new ways to implement ORMs or something totally new - we need this.

398,"2021-06-23","Launch HN: Alpas (YC W21) – Software to find suppliers for industrial parts","Hi HN, we are Nils, Isabel, and Chris - the founders of Alpas ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpas.ai&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpas.ai&#x2F;</a> ). We make it fast and easy for medium to large size manufacturers to find suppliers for industrial parts.<p>Why does this matter? Buyers at manufacturing companies face high pressure to cut costs. Supplier sourcing is still very manual and takes up to 45% of a buyer&#x27;s time. Due to the lack of research time, buyers rarely close deals at optimal conditions. Recently, Covid-19 and material shortages have further accelerated the need for more transparent supply chains.<p>Isabel came across this problem during her work as an investment analyst. She realized that optimizing procurement – the buying of goods and services – is one of the most important ways for industrial firms to save costs: more than 50% of revenue is spent on COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) [1] and sourcing is reported to be the biggest value-driver in procurement [2]. As an investment analyst she was used to a much higher level of data transparency that is available from tools such as Bloomberg or CapitalIQ. Inspired by this, we set out to build a similar experience for buyers at manufacturers.<p>After talking to lots of buyers, we found out just how manual current sourcing processes still are: managing existing suppliers in spreadsheets, web research to find new suppliers, calling and visiting suppliers on the ground. Most buyers simply don’t have the time to do a thorough supplier discovery, let alone gather all key information about them to make informed decisions.<p>Solving this problem requires gathering and analyzing supplier and supply chain data from many sources. Building such a tool represents a massive data challenge: gathering, structuring, and indexing 10B+ parameters of 10M+ suppliers worldwide from 500+ data sources. Our two biggest technical challenges are a) providing a standardized mapping of the supplier’s product portfolios and b) continuously tapping into new data sources which need to be incorporated into our existing pipelines. We use NLP models to extract specific keywords in order to create a list of potential supplier candidates. We match the suppliers to various sources using NER, which allows us to filter down candidates based on specific parameters. The result is a final supplier list with detailed information on company facts, products, financials, and much more.<p>Based on this data, we run sourcing projects with our customers, which means finding suppliers for a specific product &amp; region. Since our launch in January, we have been able to win several Fortune 500 companies, including BASF and ABB, as customers. Using our software, our customers have been able to reduce time &amp; procurement spend significantly. On a recent sourcing project, we helped ABB find new suppliers for a custom lens made out of a special material and even suggested additional suppliers for a different material with similar properties. For this project, we saved ABB 40% in procurement spend and 3 weeks of manual work.<p>Our sales process begins with a demo exploring our tool with a subset of the customer&#x27;s existing suppliers. Customers usually continue with a paid pilot - one sourcing project in a certain region. In order to access their data going forward and book more sourcing projects, customers enter into a yearly SaaS contract. Based on our current pricing, we estimate our addressable market to be at $15.8 B.<p>You can visit our HN-trial signup page ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpas.ai&#x2F;hn-trial-signup"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpas.ai&#x2F;hn-trial-signup</a> ) to create a 48-hours trial account for our software with a demo sourcing project.

725,"2021-07-15","Where the fuck did I save that? It drove me crazy, so I built a personal Google","How can it be that technology today is so sophisticated but I still have to remember where I saved my stuff, in which folder I put my document or what I have in my bookmarks, at the moment where I need it? The way we store and manage documents literally has not changed since our days of physical paper, folders and cabinets. It’s just not intuitive – when I try to remember something, I also don’t look through my brain trying to figure out where I stored it in there. I try to remember what it was about, and use as much contextual information about it as I can remember, until I have enough puzzle pieces together; “right – where did I hear about it, who told me this, when did I come across it, what other information is it related to, what was it about?” So I sat down with my talented developer friend and tried to reverse engineer the way human memory works, learning about neuroscience, speaking to knowledge management experts, going all in – and it led us to graph databases. In a graph database, items are connected to each other and carry meta descriptions, which essentially means information about the item – descriptors. And based on that, we built Reach, a completely novel way to store documents, websites, media, contacts, notes, absolutely anything. Now, finally, instead of having to remember a given folder path or certain keywords, there’s a multitude of angles from which I can get to the data I need, I can easily search for it by typing in anything I remember about it, or I can precisely navigate through my content if I’m not sure what exactly I’m searching for, I just need to know the general topic. It works like an interconnected library with copies of books in every place you could possibly need them – except they’re not copies but the same exact item appearing in all the relevant places, keeping it light. So whether you’re browsing or searching, you’re guaranteed to get to the data you need, no matter when you saved it or where you saved it. And doing it this way doesn’t only make the discovery of your content faster and more intuitive, also saving it is much quicker. You don’t need to choose or create folders and subfolders, you just throw it in there, select relationships and add any description that might be useful later on. With time, AI will automate this process. This way, we managed to build a Second Brain for all your digitally stored knowledge that works just the way you think. This also means that sharing an entire knowledge base becomes so much easier because you don’t need to tell anybody where you saved stuff, the easiest brain transplant ever. And we’re not stopping here. Next on our bucket list, we’re planning to go one step further and allow qualified users to publish their knowledge base – or ‘workspace’. This will make Reach a one-of-a-kind, curated search engine with content that’s hand-selected around a particular topic. Users who access a workspace will be able to suggest additions or modifications to the creator of the collection. This extends Reach to a powerful collaborative research and learning platform that enables anybody to develop expertise around certain subjects, with all the best selected resources in one place.

It would unlock countless opportunities for developers to reach more users.<p>There appears to be no appetite or interest in the industry to tackle this problem. Or is there?<p>I don&#x27;t consider Docker, Cloudtron, Sandstorm, command-line scripts as possible options. Developers may find them &#x27;easy&#x27;, but none of these options are easy or simple for non-technical users. Even one-click app marketplaces (Linode, Digital Ocean etc) have their complications.<p>Is the following a possibility? A common or standardised &#x27;installation&#x27; API for web apps adopted by web servers like Apache, NGINX, Caddy etc. The API covers security, permissions, installation location and even uninstallation. (I&#x27;m far too thick to figure out how it could be implemented, but one can dream.)<p>Without easy deployment for non-technical users, self-hosting will never be a viable option for most people, only for a tiny minority of technical users.

Many developers warn of the dangers of this situation, and yet the industry has done nothing to tackle the issue.

425,"2021-06-24","Ask HN: Learning Android development and I'd like some guideance","TL;DR 
Recently learned React, a bit of Flutter, but instead of learning React Native, I&#x27;m learning directly native Android Development after finishing my first app on Flutter. Doing this because I&#x27;m developing some apps for myself and also publishing them for free (no ads or any crap) on android only. Should I consider React Native instead since I already know React?<p>Long version:
I&#x27;m a 43-year-old freelance designer art director who studied to be a sysadmin (this was before dinosaurs got extinct to be fair) but ended up working in advertising.<p>Past five years or so, my mother got sick (brain stroke) and I had a really hard time keeping up with my freelance business whilst I had to take care of the recovery, accompany to rehabilitation, doctors reviews, or help at home because I couldn&#x27;t afford to hire a full-time nurse, so I&#x27;ve been mostly living from savings and a few sporadic jobs.<p>Nevertheless, the thing about this is that while I&#x27;ve been taking care of all this stuff, I&#x27;ve had some spare time, waiting in the hospital for hours or waiting between rehab sessions, you can have an idea. I took the opportunity to dedicate this time to re-ignite my nerd-self and started a web dev path with react and typescript. Also a few months ago published my first android app done in Flutter.<p>I have a friend with lots of experience who asked me Why I&#x27;m not learning React Native instead since I know already React and he pointed out like that would be the &quot;correct&quot; path.<p>So with all this, am I really making a bad call going with the android route or Should I consider React Native? Maybe because I don&#x27;t have plenty of years of experience there is something I&#x27;m not foreseeing?<p>The intention of this is to gather some insights about the topic and sane debate, not start any holy war Native vs Not native.

329,"2021-06-20","Ask HN: Am I an idiot for thinking I shouldn't get a pension?","Honest question.<p>Note: with pension, I mean any scheme where you put your money somewhere, where
someone will manage it, and supposedly you&#x27;re going to be OK for the rest of
your days after you stop working.<p>1.
I have this feeling that I&#x27;m just going to be screwed at some point if I do it.
I&#x27;d be putting my money in someone elses control. It&#x27;s more than one person, of
course, but I picture it as a 50 year old white guy in a suit. I don&#x27;t know
that guy, but I&#x27;m being told &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it, he&#x27;ll do the right thing.&quot;
But I&#x27;ve also seen people crying on television because they lost their
retirement around the year 2008. So apparently, it&#x27;s not always going to be ok.<p>2.
Even though everyone tells me investing in stocks is OK, my brain has labeled
it as &quot;gambling&quot;. You’re removing money from your wallet, and whether or not
you get the same amount back depends on an outcome you aren’t 100% sure about.
I don&#x27;t want to gamble. I <i>definitely</i> don&#x27;t want to give my retirement money
to someone who will gamble with it.<p>3.
I feel like companies that are on the stock market are acting irresponsibly.
They could go for the slow grind, but instead they get themselves in a world of
trouble by selling shares. Now they have to deal with short-sighted investors
that only care about money, not about the company itself, its employees, or its
long-term future and impact on the world. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, retirement
schemes invest in these types of companies. I just used the word &quot;invest&quot;, but
#2 still applies: in my mind this is just gambling.<p>4. 
There seems to be an alternative for me: I could buy the cheapest possible
house ASAP, save up money not spent on rent, use that to buy another house,
etc. I guess people are always going to need a place to live in. I could rent
out all houses except for the one I live in.<p>I wrote a more detailed version of my thought process here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;willfennel.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2021&#x2F;06&#x2F;18&#x2F;economy.html","general",NULL,"general"

In traditional terms, fast changing areas have a localised high FPS, lesser changing areas have a localised low FPS.
This could, for example, greatly benefit the communication between video card and monitor, relaxing bandwidth limitations.
Splash can also be used as a filter to isolate essence of movement, demonstrated by extreme high PixelsPerFrame ratios with other demos [2].<p>Splash could effectively turn a 60Hz into a 360Hz responsive monitor by sacrificing a bit of quality.<p>This is illustrated by the demo below [3], original video is 24fps and slowed down 6x:

We know computer bug is a known as a error or a fault due to a flaw in the computer program or system.<p>This bug makes various problems and we google the that bug right.<p>The first person to use the word “bug” to describe a technological error was Thomas Edison.<p>He used it in a letter that dates back to 1878. However, it wasn’t until 70 years later that the term became so popular.<p>At 3:45 p.m, September 9, 1947, the first actual incident of a computer bug was recorded. It was recorded by Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist, and member of the U.S. Navy. She was working on a Harvard Mark II computer and recorded the bug in the computer’s logbook.<p>After she noticed a hindrance in the computer’s operation, she started tracing the problem. Hopper found a dead moth that was stuck between the relay contacts of the computer. She removed the moth and taped it into Mark II’s Log. Beneath the moth, she wrote “First actual case of bug being found.”<p>Although there are some claims that other people found the moth in the computer, Hopper remains the one who did the logbook entry.<p>So this is the story of first computer bug.","general",NULL,"general"

I.e. not sulking over things that are true but you can&#x27;t do anything about.<p>Sure it&#x27;s healthy to be realistic and have good dose of pessimism, but if you have been on negative side for too long, then you need to have pendulum swung to the other side first to break the patterns deeply carved in your brain.<p>TLDR: monitor your thoughts and follow your principle of not engaging them ever","web/mobile",NULL,"general"

I was recently offered a gig with them in the Bay Area where I&#x27;d be working within a brand new machine learning research group as an engineer. Such a job sounds amazing from a tech and career development perspective, but I&#x27;m weighing the pros&#x2F;cons and finding it increasingly difficult to justify a move. My current team is also new, and I enjoy working with my teammates&#x2F;manager. Furthermore, this is my first time on the East Coast and I&#x27;m enjoying the social atmosphere, have a lower COL than the Bay, and don&#x27;t need to purchase expensive things like a car. The only compelling reason I can find to move is that on the new team, I&#x27;ll be working directly with PhDs whom I can hopefully ask for strong letters of recommendation when I apply to graduate school (most likely a Master&#x27;s Degree) in the near future.<p>My questions to HN -- (1) Is one more strong PhD letter of recommendation (I already have one) and experience working with researchers that much more valuable to graduate schools to justify the downsides of moving?

530,"2021-06-30","Ask HN: Options for curating a music library in the 2020s","My first music was in books of CDs.  Then came the iPod; I imported all my CDs into iTunes, and stuck with it longer than most. I&#x27;d regularly rate songs too, so eventually my library of thousands of songs had 0-5 star ratings, which was great for building smart playlists. Also liked that I could still easily listen to a complete album.<p>Of course I haven&#x27;t bought an album in the past 10 years or so, since everything&#x27;s on Spotify, Youtube Music, etc.  But what I&#x27;ve lost is a sense of music that&#x27;s <i>mine</i>.  When I hear a song I like now I might hit the thumbs up or whatever, but it&#x27;s not the same as adding the album to my collection.  So I&#x27;m trying to recapture a bit of that sense - of curating a selection of music that I like.  Ownership isn&#x27;t really the issue; I don&#x27;t feel a great need to actually own copies of the songs or albums, as long as whatever platform I use isn&#x27;t going to disappear without the ability to export my library&#x2F;ratings&#x2F;whatever.<p>But what I would like is some kind of better system than the lack of one I have now.  Ideally something that combines the feeling of an iTunes music library, where you have a list of songs in your library and potentially various (smart) playlists built based on genre and rating, with the reach and discovery of streaming platforms. For ratings I&#x27;d love to have star ratings and the ability to import my old ones from iTunes.  As far as discovery, Pandora used to be great at that, although they stopped supporting Canada forever ago. Spotify seems OK, and youtube music kind of crap but better than nothing.  But none of these seem to have the curation I&#x27;m going for.  There are playlists, but no real sense of a library of songs that span playlists, nor of albums as distinct entities, nor star ratings. (Although maybe I&#x27;m not using them to the fullest.)<p>Does what I want exist?  Has anyone cobbled together something close?  Am I just using these tools wrong?

That might work for some but if you are interested to explore more active investing opportunities, you will soon find yourself out-traded by funds and bots who control much of the market volume.<p>We are Gabriele, Zdenek and Oleg, founders of Coinrule https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinrule.com&#x2F;. We met back in 2017 when we were building our previous startups and met at Masschallenge, an accelerator program, in London. At that time all three of us were experimenting with cryptocurrencies investing and soon found that unless we used automation, we could not compete in a 24&#x2F;7 market. That&#x27;s when we started to think of a solution, now called Coinrule.<p>Coinrule helps beginner investor build automated rules for trading strategies, currently for cryptocurrencies but later also for other assets - it runs on top of cryptocurrency exchanges and uses an IFTTT-style interface. It&#x27;s like Zapier for investing.<p>The Cryptocurrency world came along with a lot of controversies, at the same time it gave many makers a possibility to start deconstructing finance. Also for us, cryptocurrencies are a good place to try and build a more equal way of managing your savings.<p>We are part of this market and believe in it. Our ultimate goal is to make trading more accessible and to expand Coinrule to equities, FX and later also to DeFi to give beginner investors the opportunity to manage their funds in a market full of speculators.<p>When we first started investing, we approached it from two beliefs: 1) you are unlikely to grow a portfolio without a small percentage of it allocated to more active investments and 2) tools in the market today are made by traders for advanced traders. Many of our users have learned, grown and improved as traders over the past year of using Coinrule and that&#x27;s what we think really matters.<p>Of course we understand that the HN community has a lot of cryptocurrency sceptics and we respect that. The cryptocurrency market is still full of scams and bad actors. Whether you like it or not though, it is now big enough that it is here to stay. Despite the bad reputation, there are also many genuine and hard working people trying to build technology that matters. We believe that it is worthwhile to try make cryptocurrencies an easier place to navigate for these &#x27;normal&#x27; people. If one of our users does not have the right mindset or could be vulnerable and should not be trading, we tell them that.<p>Coinrule today is registered with the UK&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority, has transacted over $500m and is run by an international and diverse team.<p>Building a product, as you all know, is hard so we&#x27;d appreciate comments and feedback. We&#x27;d love to hear anything that helps make Coinrule better, simpler and fairer. Please try us out at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinrule.com!

Back then I knew little about the country, only things I saw on the TV\Youtube\Wikipedia, and I didn&#x27;t know the IT market was booming here and, surprise, that&#x27;s my expertise. When I&#x27;ve discovered that, I&#x27;ve joined a community called IT in Dublin, which is an &quot;open source&quot; Brazilian group dedicated to helping each other to understand visas, regulations, how to improve your CVs, etc. This group helped me a lot and, after 8 months, I got a job and then I could give back to the group, helping others to follow the same path.<p>From 2015 till now a lot of information was improved, but we still receive a lot of requests&#x2F;questions from the group about the information we already have explained and provided links for anyone to have access to any information we gathered. Still, many newcomers complain that information was misleading or not useful anymore, which makes me start to think of a way to help more.<p>In 2019, I was studying and developing Machine Learning, and in one of my studies I could create a model which could give back to a potential immigrant their chances to move to another country, from that moment I thought this could be useful as a piece of information, so I decided to gather everything I knew about immigration in Ireland and Europe and create an App<p>Introducing ClusterStack<p>The goal of ClusterStack is to be a one-stop shop for immigrants, to help anyone who wants to move to a country, to do it safely . And, after a lot of research and studies , I&#x27;ve identified and simplified the steps needed for wannabe immigrants to fully reposition themselves elsewhere. To do so, they need to have access to :<p>- Information about the country visa process, cost of living, avg. salary of their specialisation, and their chances to move to a country .<p>- Ability to apply for job positions of companies that accept international candidates  .<p>- A tool that automatically handles the candidate visa application .<p>- A social networking helps the migrant to be embedded in their new community .<p>As I was developing this App, I saw I needed to do this project in parts, first focusing on certain types of foreigners, information, and jobs.So for now, as ICT workers are more likely to get visa approvals, I’ve finished the first part of the app for those in that area, so if you’re a tech employee, you can go onto the App and you can check all sorts of information... and jobs to apply, FOR FREE.<p>For recruiters who might see this post, I’m open for partner with you, more jobs that provide help for those who seek to move abroad the better.<p>You can download it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lnkd.in&#x2F;dfYJhPB<p>So, if you find it could be interesting, give it a try.<p>Just a quick reminder: As a solo programmer of this App, there&#x27;s a lot of bugs and problems, mainly on Android, if you spot something, please let me know.","web/mobile",NULL,"job/career"

The user pays to run your code, instead of you paying to run the server that serves them the code.
This is because everyone who&#x27;s running an Ethereum node actually has a copy of your code in the blockchain.<p>This is called a &quot;smart contract&quot; but enough people have experimented with it that they&#x27;ve actually built decentralised applications - dApps for short.<p>There are now real world examples of decentralised applications in Finance - DeFi - which includes a Decentralised exchange - uniswap - and decentralised finance like Compound, Balancer and Yield Finance. So there are apps. You can get a loan from a DeFi app today.<p>This seems like it has huge disruptive potential. Mark Cuban has talked about how he could sell tickets as NFTs on the blockchain, and get a percentage of resell, forever.<p>You could in theory build something similar for Airbnb or Uber on the blockchain - just NFT a house&#x2F;day and then sell it on the blockchain. Same thing with Uber - drivers could auction off their time in a blockchain dApp.<p>Because devs don&#x27;t pay to keep their code in the ETH blockchain, you can just build software and it will &quot;run&quot; forever, at no cost to the developer.<p>This is a radical change and imo a huge avenue for new innovation.<p>But this is hardly talked about here in HN.<p>Let&#x27;s ignore, if possible, the whole &quot;proof of work is bad for the environment&quot; question (all I&#x27;ll say about that is proof of stake is real and in production with DOT&#x2F;ALGO and that&#x27;s a 99% reduction in energy consumption).

767,"2021-07-17","Tea Changes, Bending, Indonesia","TEA BLENDING AT HOME    I am a serious &quot;Tea-Head&quot;.  In the last 20 years I have become adept at simple blending.  The first secret of tea blending is that Ceylon teas are the most powerful blending teas. 10% to 15% Ceylon can magically transform an undrinkable Puttabong 2nd flush into a palatable Darjeeling.<p>INDONESIAN TEA   About 20 years ago, Indonesia discovered that it could grow and ferment black tea in high quantity. —A highly inferior black tea, to be sure; but, IF expertly blended, usable as the base for grocery store teas.  Today, almost ALL grocery store teas have replaced their African tea base with cheaper Indonesian tea.     E.g., circa 2009, Lipton CHANGED IT&#x27;S USA BLEND. For over 100 years, the USA Lipton blend was THE superior grocery store tea. Lipton used 25 teas to make the blend. About, 40% African, 20% Indian, 20% Chinese and 10% Ceylon. This explains why the old Lipton USA blend WAS superior. —Hence, Lipton&#x27;s usage of the word &quot;BRISK&quot; in its advertising.     Solution; return to the old days, and buy only single estate Chinese and Indian teas. You will have better success with Chinese tea. You can NOT go wrong buying Darjeeling from The Makaibari and Castleton estates.     Buy some modest Ceylon.  If you get stuck with a poor Darjeeling, add 10% - 20% Ceylon tea and you will discover that you have a good Darjeeling after all. Any tea that has too much tannic acid; —just add a little Ceylon and it will usually be instantly transformed into a drinkable tea.<p>DYI BLENDING AND BUYING TEA    About 20 years ago, I began to experiment with some modest blending of my own.  My first success was to convert an undrinkable Puttabong Darjeeling to an enjoyable, palatable blend. All I did was blend with 10% - 20% of a modest Ceylon!  I paid way too much for the Puttabong, but this taught me that just because it is a Darjeeling does NOT mean that it is good.  The Puttabong estate is in the most northern region of Darjeeling.     After a few more northern single estate Darjeelings, I learned my lesson!  —Stick to the more southern Darjeelings.  If you are new to Darjeeling tea, buy only Makaibari or Castleton Darjeeling (be sure it IS from one of these estates!).    I buy more Chinese tea than Darjeeling. Let&#x27;s face it, the Chinese have been at this game for far longer than anyone else. &quot;All the tea in China&quot; is not an empty expression. I have never bought bad single estate Chinese tea. In fact, I rarely find blended Chinese teas for sale.  In short, the Chinese know more about making good tea than any other people.  If you buy an inexpensive —Yunnan or Hunan, you cannot go wrong.  E.g. my favourite Keemun single estate costs me about £15 for a half kilo, and this lasts for at least 8 months (keep tea well-wrapped and in your ice box).  This Keemun has a great malty taste with overtones of chocolate, yet clearly presents itself as a Keemun Chinese tea. Tea is relatively inexpensive and life is too short to drink bad tea.  If you want to simplify everything, just buy any Chinese Yunnan you find on the web along with a small amount of an average Ceylon for blending your grocery store teas into palatability.      If you crave the Indian taste, why not try ASSAM?  The Assam region of India produces a more consistent product than The Darjeeling District.  —Never had a poor Assam. Assam is full of caffeine and almost matches African tea for caffeine (50% less than strong coffee).  —Good with milk or brewed lightly without milk. You cannot go wrong.","general",NULL,"general"

I have yet to a scam as lucrative as this one...not just profitability but impunity.<p>Even cartel&#x2F;drug gangs and dealers  and the mafia would be envious of these kind of risk-free profits (no DEA, no FBI, no dealing with rival gangs, etc). Same for ransonware, in which there is too much risk relative to reward.<p>If the scammer asks someone to send between $200-$200k+ of doge&#x2F;btc, etc, in the promise of 2x more, some will send the max amount or close to it , which is like a single major ransomware payout but without all the risk and huge footprint that comes from spreading ransomware. The fat right side of the victim-distribution tail is in large  why this scam earns so well.<p>My estimates give a total of $40 million stolen with twitter and $40 million with youtube since 2018 years with the bulk 90% of the profits in 2020-2021. The higher bitcoin goes, the more $ they make. It&#x27;s hard to say which is better, Twitter vs. YouTube. Twitter I think is more lucrative only because of elon musk. 50 million followers + traffic from retweets means applying the Drake Equation to it guarantees a lot of $ and victims.

837,"2021-07-19","Tell HN: Coming soon – “Meet the Batch” threads for parallel Launch HNs","Each YC startup gets one chance to do a Launch HN thread that gets placed on HN&#x27;s front page [1]. This is one of the three things that HN gives back to YC in exchange for funding it [2]. We started doing these in 2017 and they&#x27;ve worked out pretty well over the years [3], I think mostly because they&#x27;re more interesting than job ads. However, they have to be written in a special way for that to work (more on this below).<p>Problem: HN&#x27;s front page can only accommodate a fixed number of startups while YC keeps funding more (700+ a year and growing). We do two Launch HNs a day during the stampede before each Demo Day, but I think we overdid that in W21, and even 2 per day all year, which is out of the question, still wouldn&#x27;t be enough.<p>Other problem: I work with the startups to edit their launch texts into a form that HN is more likely to find interesting. Mostly this consists of cajoling, persuading, and (when that fails) forcing them not to sound like marketing, sales, or PR. If you&#x27;d like to see the instructions we give founders about this, they&#x27;re at [4].<p>Founders are used to talking to customers and investors, and those styles are terrible for HN, so most Launch HNs need a lot of editing. Unlike the front page, this work should be scalable, but it has to be done by someone who&#x27;s familiar with what HN likes and what its conventions are, and it hasn&#x27;t (yet) proven easy to train anyone to do it—you sort of have to dip them in the vat of HN over and over until they get steeped, and most people don&#x27;t want to be dipped in a vat, or at least not this vat. So in practice I still do the editing and am still the bottleneck. 40 startups are currently in the pipe and it&#x27;s backing up faster than I can process them.<p>Hence, new idea time: we&#x27;re going to try aggregate launch threads for YC startups, tentatively called &quot;Meet the Batch&quot;. These will be like Launch HNs, but with more than one startup, and shorter blurbs. Each startup will post its blurb as a comment and then HN readers can discuss and interact with the ones they find interesting.<p>Since each of these will be in lieu of a Launch HN, the number of frontpage threads won&#x27;t go up, but throughput will. We have no idea how well it will work—it&#x27;s just an experiment. We&#x27;ll probably start with one per week and do traditional Launch HNs the rest of the time.<p>Which startups will get standalone Launch HNs vs. being in the aggregate threads? I&#x27;ll decide that based mostly on what I think HN is likely to find interesting. That&#x27;s <i>not</i> the same thing as which startups are good (or I think are good!) so please don&#x27;t take it as that sort of signal.<p>So anyway, that&#x27;s the plan. I wanted to give you all a heads-up, first so you know what to expect, and second so we can answer any questions and have any meta discussion now, instead of later when comments should really be about the startups. If you have questions, feedback, flames, or hounds to unleash, have at it—also, any ideas about how we can do any of this better are most welcome.<p>p.s.

We use machine learning to extract hard-to-find information and assess risk in public company reports (SEC filings). Our platform is used by investors to improve portfolio returns and mitigate downside risks.<p>Most public company data is unstructured and textual. Because relevant information is hard to find, a lot of corporate data is radically underused, to the detriment of investors. For example, our research shows it can take 12-18 months for corporate malfeasance to be incorporated into stock price after clear warning signs appear in financial text.  Hard-to-find information that we extract includes accounting and governance choices, product defects, regulatory issues, customer&#x2F;market reliance and much more.<p>One example is Sino-Forest, Canada&#x27;s Enron. Sino-Forest was a darling of Canadian investors until an infamous exposé, by short-seller Muddy Waters, in 2011. It turned out it was a forestry company that didn’t actually own any forests. Months before the exposé and crash, there were obvious red flags in the company’s disclosures including buying and selling from companies controlled by their directors and problems with the review of their bookkeeping! Our algorithms picked up these red flags and more, and assessed Sino-Forest as high risk when we ran our models on the company’s historical filings.<p>I’m a CPA and a developer (odd combo).  The tech community has largely ignored public company financial disclosure.  A few years ago, I published a basic piece using computational methods to analyze cannabis disclosure. The local regulatory agency contacted me to give them a workshop on text analytics. It was then that it hit home how little was being done in the field.<p>Information drives financial markets. The difficulty of assessing risks hidden in long public filings makes earning manipulation, and even fraud, both possible and profitable. Earnings manipulation involves using the flexibility in accounting standards to make financial statements look better than reality. This is easier than most people realize because accounting involves MANY choices and estimates.<p>There is money to be made by accessing and trading on underused predictive signals. Making money by stopping fraud is a win-win situation.<p>There are two main technical challenges thwarting progress in the field: (1) NLP models work best on short (500 character) text, but financial filings are hundreds of pages long, and (2) important and unimportant language sounds very similar in financial text. For instance, this sentence sounds like it could be indicative of terrible things going on behind the scenes but is in fact, just boilerplate disclosure: “We face risks and uncertainties related to litigation, regulatory actions and government investigations and inquiries.” You can see how ML models easily get confused.<p>There’s a big gap in both academia and industry. A lot of effort is being put into forcing results from non-existent linguistic signals. Models that claim to predict specific outcomes often don’t hold up to scrutiny in practice.<p>In order to overcome the technical challenges we used supervised and semi-supervised learning with high quality labels, we focused on tangible facts represented in textual context, and we adapted language models using domain expertise.<p>As far as we know, no other solution is able to identify problematic&#x2F;risky disclosure algorithmically. Using search terms to do something similar results in overwhelming noise. The disclosure selected by our algorithms is highly predictive of downside risk - validated in deployment and also in backtesting.<p>We launched our core product in April 2021 (see <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrock-ai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrock-ai.com</a>) and it’s used by hedge funds and institutional investors. We’re also doing a pilot to support Canadian securities regulators (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3wOwOj6"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3wOwOj6</a>).  We’ve also just launched a minimalist free site, Ledge (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ledge.bedrock-ai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ledge.bedrock-ai.com</a>), to help retail investors stay up to date on material events at companies they follow. Companies are required to disclose material events between their quarterly reports, but these disclosures rarely make the news.<p>Our core&#x2F;premium product is currently only available to institutions, in part because retail investors generally don’t prioritize risk management and therefore aren’t committed customers. We plan to expand the free site and better support individual investors as we grow.<p>We would love to hear from you. Have you tried to read annual reports and gotten lost in the weeds?

This dynamic had a time of 15 minutes and basically, we asked people silly things, and made people animate their most subjective brain, the right side of their brain, where is everything that is silly, where is everything that is creativity, intuition, art, creation, let’s say so. And we started asking people things like “if you were a vegetable, what would you be?”, “if you were an item or a kitchen utensil, what would you do?”, “if you could be a specific time of day, what would you choose?”, “if you could be a chocolate brand, what brand would you be?”, “if you could change your name, what name would you choose?”. And all these questions made us, in a very quick way, stay in a much more subjective paradigm, much more creative, much more peaceful, which animates the parasympathetic much more than if we came to a room and asked, “give me 10 ideas to solve the problem of our economy”.<p>Because basically, we need to blur our minds to better focus, what we need to learn to swim is to gently almost drown. And then we start with this Q&amp;Angry Shotgun, which is already a dynamic that we do in our daily life. There is even a blog post on the Angry Ventures blog on this topic. Basically, it’s a weekly question we ask everyone, and it’s also usually a very silly question, where we ask everyone and then everyone answers as well. We are already on Q&amp;Angry 170&#x2F;180, we do one every week.So, we started with this dynamic, which has to be done quickly, that is, when the facilitator asks something, the answer has to be given in 1 or 2 seconds, it’s the first thing that comes to mind. The facilitator always must exist in this project, in this case it was me, but it could be anyone else. Then, in 15 minutes and in groups of 2, we made a second dynamic, which we named How Might We?<p>Read full article here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fernandomoreira.me&#x2F;how-to-make-a-product-in-a-day&#x2F;","general",NULL,"general"

820,"2021-07-19","Why do programmers accept current technical interview practices?","Most other jobs don&#x27;t ask you to perform a pale staged imitation of what your real job would be before they hire you.<p>We have resumes to prove our past work, and yet we keep having to prove we know how to implement fibonacci on a whiteboard or rediscover the wheel of sorting algorithms that are already implemented in the languages we use.<p>Technical interviews don&#x27;t even remotely reflect ability to do the job, at best they show that you can write basic code, which isn&#x27;t enough.<p>More importantly, for me the big flaws in those interviews are:<p>- They&#x27;re very susceptible to bad luck or bad days. Projects in real life don&#x27;t last an hour, sometimes you will do something easily and sometimes not. In interviews, a problem might be about an algorithm you know about, or about one you never heard of.<p>- It gives an edge to people who have time to do &quot;interview homework&quot;, which effectively means the best strategy for succeeding at interviews is to not be employed, and if you interview while still being employed you&#x27;re putting yourself at a disadvantage<p>- It makes some personality types more likely to succeed. Anyone who gets stressed &quot;performing&quot; in front of an audience will have more trouble. Reading a problem and finding a solution for it in real time for an audience during a test is very different from what people do on the job.<p>- It&#x27;s basically a school test. We&#x27;re not school children, we have resumes and past projects to attest of our ability to do our job (unless it&#x27;s your very first job obviously)<p>I am so tired of having to learrn linked list algorithms for big company interviews, or having to spend a week-end of my life to do a code test. Those things make it super hard to schedule interviews and tests around work too because it&#x27;s basically a second job, and makes it impossible to consider more than a small handful of companies at a time.<p>There are literally entire startups based around providing what is effectively homework to prepare for interviews, and they&#x27;re even sponsored by FAANG companies which literally expect you to practice their interview questions before going on the interview. It makes no sense.<p>Are there any companies that are starting to move away from that? Could we just collectively agree to just stop agreeing to those practices? Why is it considered normal for me to have to schedule a 2 hour technical interview in the middle of your current job&#x27;s workday?","job/career",NULL,"job/career"
833,"2021-07-19","Founding a Non-Profit FOSS Company","One of the dreams that I have is to found a non-profit software company that develops and provides free, open-source software for the public good.  I am passionate about personal computing and how it has empowered users for nearly 50 years.  I am also increasingly concerned about market trends that serve to take power away from users and give it back to platform owners, such as subscription-based software, restrictive app stores and notarization requirements, adware, and surveillance.  I believe that these market trends are not the result of malice, but are the result of market incentives; companies stand to make more money with today&#x27;s business models than with the business models of the 1980s and 1990s.  However, I feel that the notion of user empowerment has become not only an afterthought, but rather antithetical to today&#x27;s business models, which encourage a sharp division between user (which is increasingly thought of as a consumer versus a producer) and programmer instead of some type of combination, such as the Smalltalk environment and Hypercard.  I would love to found a non-profit company that is dedicated to the continued development of personal, desktop computing as an empowering tool rather than as a media consumption device that serves as a vehicle to serve ads and sell subscription services.<p>However, since I&#x27;m not wealthy, I need to consider how to procure funding to start such a company.  Writing a competitive desktop and suite of applications is a major effort that will take many engineers.  Assuming they are not volunteers, this is millions of dollars in salary alone.  I&#x27;m also concerned about the viability of a non-profit FOSS company, given worries about the future of Firefox.  I wonder if there are successful examples of non-profit FOSS companies, or if I would be breaking new ground by pursuing this idea?","web/mobile",NULL,"web/mobile"

869,"2021-07-21","Launch HN: Epsilon3 (YC S21) – Software for spacecraft and complex operations","Hi HN, we’re Laura, Max, and Aaron, the founders of Epsilon3 (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epsilon3.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epsilon3.io&#x2F;</a>). We make software to help space companies run billion-dollar missions and avoid costly and disastrous mistakes.<p>When you&#x27;re building a rocket or satellite, you have written checklists and procedures for how to test and operate it. Believe it or not, most companies still do this on paper or Microsoft Word. We are making this digital. Think of it like supercharged checklists plus version control (like Asana + Github). This is useful for the space industry and anyone else with complex testing and operational workflows.<p>There is massive growth right now in the number of space startups and of spacecraft and people launching into space. Payloads are being launched multiple times per day; you don’t hear about most of those on the news. There are so many companies building amazing technology for space (hotels, debris removal, construction robots, etc.). But to support this growth and keep everyone safe, the industry needs massively better software than the inefficient and error-prone stuff that’s out there now. U.S. space mission failures have cost $18.6B ($31B worldwide), and the average company wastes $400,000 in engineering hours per year managing procedures inefficiently.<p>We are a team of engineering and design leaders from SpaceX, Google, Northrop Grumman, and Stanford. I spent 11 years at SpaceX and 5 years at Northrop working on spacecraft operations. I’ve taken part in over 100 launches and was the lead trainer for astronauts who went to the space station and back last year. I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t when it comes to software tools and managing operations.<p>Starting Epsilon3 came as a surprise—we were surprised that it was still necessary! I had always envisioned a unified set of tools to operate vehicles and complex engineering systems, and assumed that one existed that I just hadn’t come across yet. But after I left SpaceX and began talking to my colleagues and friends in the industry, it became clear that the tools they wanted (and that I wanted too) just didn’t exist yet. In calls with colleagues across the industry, I heard “I’d use that if it existed,” “I’ve looked for that but never found anything remotely close to what I’d want,” “If you build it, people will use it,” and “Wow, that would be great, tell me when you have an MVP.” So we were lucky to start from the beginning with the knowledge that people were in need of our platform.<p>Our software brings complex operational procedures into a modern web-based platform, built using React, Node, CouchDB, Flask, and Supabase, and running on AWS GovCloud for ITAR compliance. We support the entire life cycle of a project from integration and testing through live operations. With Epsilon3, you can create, revise, and track procedures online with critical mission data collaboratively, all in one place and in a standardized way. Real-time synchronization of procedure status and updates guarantee that everyone’s always on the same page and knows who is doing what, when, and where.<p>This may not sound like the hardest software problem out there, but this industry has a lot of challenges that more ordinary project management tools can’t handle, which is why these projects have stuck with Microsoft Word and spreadsheets (and even paper) for so long. Real-time synchronization of data and user interfaces across earth and space with low latency and high reliability is hard. Supporting complex workflows and detailed tracking while also maintaining simplicity and delightfulness of user experience is also hard. There is also a lot of telemetry and commanding data involved, and finding ways to display and visualize it is tricky. There are mission-critical security and reliability requirements. Finally, everyone’s workflows and data are in different formats and have different needs, and finding generalized solutions and methodologies to support all of them is challenging.<p>Our vision is that when operating your system, you’ll need only two tools to manage it: your C2 (command and control) system, and Epsilon3. You won’t need to communicate via email, chat, tickets, etc. anymore. You also won’t need to store your data on a hard drive or manage an Excel spreadsheet. This will not only simplify your operation, but it will make it easier for the next generation of operators to come up to speed quickly and enable future spacecraft automation.<p>While doing hot fire testing of new rocket engines, one of our customers said, “Epsilon3 makes some incredible software that we use for our engine test operations (among other things) to make sure we don’t blow ourselves up.” Running hardware testing for new robotics, transportation, and spacecraft hardware, another customer said, “It&#x27;s made running our tests much easier and more systematic.” Those sorts of comments are what we hope to achieve industry-wide!<p>A video demo is available at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3AItU2w"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3AItU2w</a>.

I&#x27;ve been thinking about if&#x2F;how classical music will continue to make sense economically in the coming decades.<p>First, recordings. It seems to me like CM recordings have already reached a sort of peak, to the point that further <i>significant</i> improvements aren&#x27;t really possible. Countless high-quality recordings of all major works are widely available on Spotify&#x2F;Youtube, so the &quot;need&quot; for a recording of a given Beethoven sonata or Haydn quartet has been filled many times over. New releases tend not to be markedly better than existing recordings (in my opinion)—certainly not so much better as to justify the enormous time and monetary investment that goes into making them. The &quot;newness&quot; element of popular music (popular music is always changing and reflects the zeitgeist&#x2F;aesthetic of the age in which it is made) obviously doesn&#x27;t apply to CM.<p>(Of course there is &quot;modern&quot; CM, but it generally does not catch on in any major way due to inaccessibility, being over-academic, not sounding very &quot;nice&quot;, etc.)<p>Second, live performances. Live performances compete with an overwhelming range of entertainment options: Netflix, social media, Youtubers, Spotify, unlimited movies&#x2F;documentaries for download, and of course all other &quot;live&quot; entertainment options from Broadway to Sleep No More to art jams. Do people value live classical music performances enough that they will choose them over these other options enough of the time? In my circles, I rarely see live classical music winning out over other options that require a lower activation energy and&#x2F;or less money. It&#x27;s easier and cheaper to download a movie to watch with your girlfriend on an average Friday night than to go to a concert. And if it is a good movie, it might provide enjoyment equal to or greater than that of a CM concert.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly want to contribute to the doom and gloom narrative of classical music, but these are my genuine observations. If you disagree with them, or if I am missing something important, I would love to hear from you.<p>My broad question is: does classical music have a real economic future? Do people want this product enough?<p>Note: I&#x27;m not interested in the issue of CM bringing joy&#x2F;value to the performers&#x2F;practitioners—for this discussion I am specifically interested in the value of CM to consumers.","general",NULL,"general"

875,"2021-07-21","A unique argument for loosely typed programming languages","I&#x27;ve been programming for a long time.  Over the years I&#x27;ve become way too familiar with the back and forth arguments between different programming language philosophies.  I&#x27;ve generally avoided the more religious of the arguments, but know from reading blogs and such that there are definitely plenty of people in the developer community with perspectives on the extreme ends of the spectrum.  One of those debates has to do with strongly vs loosely typed languages.<p>Most of my career I&#x27;ve worked in languages that are on the more loosely typed side of the argument, but never immersed myself in the other end of the spectrum enough to have much of an opinion.  Until recently.  Because of the sheer number of jobs available for Java and C#, and those typically being the higher paying of the bunch, it&#x27;s always been in the back of my mind that I probably should do some homework and bring those skills up to snuff.<p>It&#x27;s not been difficult.  I&#x27;ve been able to transition into these languages mostly seamlessly it seems.  However, one thing I&#x27;m noticing is my productivity is way down.  Part of that, admittedly, is because I&#x27;m less familiar with the languages.  But now that I&#x27;m familiar enough I can take a step back and see pretty clearly that I almost certainly will NEVER be able to get to my previous levels of productivity simply due to the nature of these languages.  The fact that they&#x27;re statically typed seems to have &quot;on its own&quot; been responsible for perhaps as much as 60-80% of these languages&#x27; bloat.  If I don&#x27;t know how to do something in a loosely typed language I maybe have to refer to a single page of documentation.  When working with strongly-typed languages though, I feel like sometimes in order to get the full picture of what I&#x27;m trying to do, I have to jump around to so many pages of documentation I find sometimes I need to step back to reflect on what it was I was trying to do in the first place to make sure I haven&#x27;t drifted off on a tangent.<p>One argument that is pretty common is the fact that statically typed languages guarantee certain levels of completeness.  If it compiles it probably works.  Then again, when I look at the trade-off as to what is necessary in order to make that possible, I&#x27;d prefer to be independently proficient and (if necessary &#x2F; desired) I&#x27;d want to be able to (as I&#x27;ve done many times in the past) complete large-scale projects on my own in their entirety in a relatively short period of time.  I feel like having complete autonomy in what you&#x27;re doing SHOULD be a virtue all of us as developers should really strive for.<p>Granted, our minds work differently and so it&#x27;s obvious in the open source world that there are a few human beings who have the capacity to create enormous projects on their own in these languages.  If I had to guess I would think it&#x27;s not many people when compared to the number of people who work in loosely typed languages who have accomplished comparably grand achievements.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly how one would measure this, but knowing what I know now about both ends of this spectrum, I&#x27;d bet a pretty hefty sum of money that a far larger number of people have been able to achieve comparably amazing things using loosely-typed programming languages as compared with strongly typed languages.  If anyone knows of actual metrics being used to track this sort of thing I&#x27;d definitely love to learn more.","web/mobile",NULL,"web/mobile"

896,"2021-07-24","Corehash Protocol – Decentralized hashrate liquidity provision with HashFi","Hi everyone,<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a project called Corehash for a while. I&#x27;m a solo founder with no team, but I&#x27;ve been envisioning a new protocol that can change the way we look at finance and hashpower from the bottom up - by using smart contracts to create a vault similar to Aave or Yearn, but with a simple hashrate product constant formula, similar to Uniswap, to enable liquidity provision of hashrate demand, through an internalized hashrate token AMM model.<p>I&#x27;ve published a white paper that goes into the full details, you can read it here: www.corehash.org&#x2F;whitepaper.pdf, or you can read it on Medium: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;corehash&#x2F;corehash-hashpower-liquidity-provision-vault-staking-protocol-c12d5dfd2fc2<p>It also has some interesting use cases with MEV extraction and frontrunning as well, like with Flashbots, creating a MEV premium hashrate market protocol, as well as a MEV protection market like sequencers, but fully on the base-layer blockchain, at the miner level, interfacing directly with miners and searchers.<p>This is all the research I&#x27;ve been making on my own, and I finally released it to the public, and I wanted to see if there was anyone interested in collaborating, or just community building something like this for the masses, fully open-sourced, grassroots, decentralized, through a DAO governance + community from the ground up.I&#x27;ve laid out the groundwork from my past development with some others on the previous iteration of this project, while you can check out on Github, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;corehash, it&#x27;s all very preliminary, but I&#x27;ve setup the organization to try to form a hub for contributors to work on it together, sort of like the cutting edge MEV research and with Flashbots&#x27; approach (although they have backing from Paradigm, and super talented devs).<p>The goal here is to solve problems and provide a solution as well as a whole new way to enable decentralized finance bridged with PoW mining income. You can kind of think of it as taking some of the best projects in the DeFi space and adding a token economic system for liquidity mining hashrate demand liquidity directly from miners through the pool mining protocol level, integrated on-chain with smart contracts and oracles. In theory, you could achieve some pretty cool applications, like Alchemix, with self-paying loans, but instead with mining income, and undercollateralized loans like a line of credit with hashpower, income-generating, reserve assets. OlympusDAO, but with hashrate reserve assets, stablecoins like USDC but backed by hashpower vault assets.<p>You can read more in detail in the white paper, and I hope to hear anyone thoughts and discussion of this, providing constructive feedback.","finance",NULL,"web/mobile"

175,2021-06-14,Launch HN: Revery.AI (YC S21) Scalable deep learning-based virtual dressing room,"Hi HN! We are Kedan, Jeff, and Min Jin and we are co-founders of Revery AI. We&#x27;ve built a virtual dressing room for online retailers that allows customers to visualize any combination of garments on any model.<p>The rise of online shopping has posed significant challenges for fashion retailers. The lack of ability to try on and visualize outfits has made shopping less interactive, contributing to low conversion rates and high return rates compared to brick-and-mortar shopping. Virtual dressing rooms can recreate the lost experience of trying on clothes in person. There are other companies working on a virtual dressing room. However, the reason why this is not taking off is scalability. Fashion ecommerce platforms have thousands, if not millions of SKUs. Current approaches generally require custom Photoshop work or expensive 3D models which are difficult to scale. In contrast, our solution leverages our machine learning research to automate the entire process, resulting in the first scalable virtual dressing room that can be easily integrated with any large e-commerce platform with millions of SKUs.<p>Rather than time-consuming 3d modeling, our system works with basic images. The goal, of course, is to produce accurate and realistic visualizations of outfits on people. A naive solution would be to simply copy-paste the garment onto the model. This presents two problems. 1) If the poses of the model&#x2F;garment are mismatched, copy-paste does not work. 2) Even with ideal poses, copy-paste does not take into account garment-garment, garment-model interactions and also ignores lighting, shadows, etc. We use deep learning to overcome this problem. For problem 1) we use a series of image warpers to warp the garment onto an approximate body location in the appropriate pose. This differs from current approaches that typically use only a single warp which is extremely limited. For 2) we train an image generator that takes in relevant inputs (includes the model image, garment image, pose, etc) and produces a realistic image of the model wearing the garment. Our system produces significant improvements in size, fit, and drape compared to prior art, allowing us to create realistic images of any model wearing any combination of garments.

Additionally, we’ve seen increases in average order value (AOV) and decreases in return rates. Our solution also presents several use cases beyond the virtual dressing room. Because image generation is at the heart of our business, clients have also expressed interest in using our services to generate photoshoot images to forgo expensive studio photography.<p>Funnily enough, we have never envisioned ourselves doing a start-up in the fashion space as our backgrounds are all in computer science and research. We are all computer vision Ph.D. students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and virtual try-on was initially just an academic pursuit. Kedan was researching fashion AI applications such as product recommendation while Min Jin was working on image generation and manipulation.

One might wonder, why is all this fluffy stuff with variable names necessary?
Here is the story how I came up with the prompt above.
I first tried to do the same without these variables, and it fails, and I think I know why.<p>It fails to add the penultimate element (the 9th element of a list of 10 elements), constantly. When I click it, I see its probability was 40% and the probability of last was 60% roughly. It&#x27;s very similar to how we humans reasons when we are told a list of 10 numbers. We remember the first ones (a sequence) the last one (because being the last is an event), but we might forget about some elements in between, or think we have to finish the computation quickly.
I thought, how do we humans augment our memory abilities, like to remember 100 items? From experimenting it myself, I knew that associative memories augment the capacity to remember things. For example, to remember 100 items, I can think of walking through a place of 100 rooms I know, and imagine an item in each room.
What would be the equivalent for GPT-3? Associate the numbers to add with something else. I thought, let&#x27;s put variable names.",web/mobile,finance,AI/Data Science

71,2021-06-10,Launch HN: Okay (YC W20) – Analytics for engineering teams,"Antoine and Tomas here - we are excited to share Okay (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okayhq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okayhq.com</a>) with you! Okay is an engineering analytics platform focused on detecting bottlenecks and annoyances that prevent engineering teams from being fully productive. We connect with all the devtools in your company and give you a query and alerting engine to find and solve common bottlenecks like long review cycles, after-hours on-call pages, heavy interview load, etc. Think Datadog or Grafana, but for team analytics.<p>For the past 12 years, we’ve been engineers and then managers of teams of 5 to 150 in several types of companies - startups and big tech. We’ve seen the dev experience being affected by the same problems everywhere: maybe it’s a slow build on your local machine, too many meetings and interviews, or inefficient code review practices that force you to open 10 PRs in parallel to make progress on a given week. We personally struggled with automated tests suites that would take 4 hours to complete and we saw teammates become so desensitized to heavy oncall load that they would stop complaining and just give up.<p>We also learned that the discussion about engineering metrics always falls into a false dichotomy: don’t measure anything because engineering is creative work (it is!) or measure engineers in intrusive ways along meaningless dimensions like lines of code. We believe that the way to overcome this false dichotomy is to apply quantitative measurements <i>empathetically</i>, that is, with a clear understanding of the human impacts of what&#x27;s being measured on the people doing the actual work - for example, by measuring how noisy on-call pages disrupt an engineer’s life after hours. The key is to focus on bottlenecks instead of output, and on the team level rather than on individuals. So we set out to build a product where you can see all the data from all your dev tools, query it, make sense of trends, and build alerts for when things go wrong.<p>At its core, Okay is an end-to-end analytics platform focused on engineering data. First, we ingest data from tools like Google Calendar, Github, Pagerduty, etc. We join it with the team structure that we find in services like Workday. In addition to pre-built integrations, you can also use a tracing-like API to capture e.g. how long local builds are taking. Then, we clean up and enrich the signal: tagging interviews correctly, rebuilding the full history of a PR as a connected chain of review events, inferring dimensions like tenure (which can e.g. help capture new hire experience). Finally, we expose all this data in a query builder UI that closely maps to the underlying SQL query, and we enable users to choose from visualizations we built specifically for representing engineering work: time series of course, but also calendars (e.g. to understand the life of a PR) or heatmaps (e.g. to identify a painful on-call rotation quickly). The opinionated part of Okay is all in the data modeling we do on behalf of users - we aim to reflect our values (team-based vs individuals) and to retain a lot of expressiveness so that users can ask questions like “what is the code review experience of our new hires in our NYC office compared to the SF office?”.<p>You can check how Okay works by going to our website (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okayhq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okayhq.com</a>) or checking our product video (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jzzo3m4280k"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jzzo3m4280k</a>). We don’t have free trials because once you identify bottlenecks and set the right alerts to create new habits, it usually takes several weeks to see the changes happen - we’re talking about humans working together after all, so it does require a little bit of upfront investment. We price based on the number of users and engineers on the team.<p>If you are interested or have specific questions for your use-case, we’d love to connect with your team directly in the comments. Thanks!",web/mobile,web/mobile,AI/Data Science
38,2021-06-09,Ask HN: How to scale or rearchitect a single portal site to a multi-tenant SaaS,"I don&#x27;t even know if I worded that title correctly but here is my case in simple English.<p>I built a site for a school to manage their alumni association. So it&#x27;s a complete site with a dashboard that exists at say example.com where they can create new campaigns, add pictures, add news posts etc. After a while, some other schools also wanted the same portal as I built for the one school. I don&#x27;t know how many more will want this kind of site, but many more will it seems. So instead of building out each site individually, I want to build a SaaS of sorts. So that each school can sign up and spin up it&#x27;s own such alumni association site. All the portals will be accessible from one TLD, so the url will be something like example.com&#x2F;school1 or school1.example.com.<p>I have never built something like this, so I have several questions:<p>1) I&#x27;m guessing I can use the site I have as a template to spin off new sites in the new SaaS?<p>2) What is the correct term for this multi-tenant setup so that I know how to speak when I ask questions or do consultations?<p>3) What resources can I use to learn to build such a multi-tenant infrastructure?

However, your compensation is zero along with the ISP, and the beneficiary is mostly Amazon.<p>For that matter, Apple&#x27;s Find My service seems similar to Sidewalk with a key difference.

73,2021-06-10,How can it be that unlimited high costs can arise with AWS?,"Hello all,<p>I would like your opinion on unlimited costs at AWS.<p>One of my customers, had, the perfect use case for the Step Functions I read about. I worked with it for a few days and was able to see the first results quite quickly. Shortly after that, I started the service that used the API gateway to accept data and process it through multiple processes using Step Functions. The cost was about 50$-100$ per day. Due to another feature request, from my customer, I extended the Step Function with a waiting loop, which looked ideal in my mind. Unfortunately, my idea turned out to be a big mistake. I built some kind of loop in one of the steps. At the beginning everything looked fine and my workflow worked exactly as it should. I watched the Step Machine for another day. Everything looked good and I took a few days off after a stressful time. However, in my absence the queue kept growing and suddenly I had 1000 tasks running in parallel and the costs shot up to $2000 a day. On the last day of my little break, I pulled up the AWS iOS app and frightened when I saw the &quot;Estimated Costs&quot; for this month. 33,000 $.<p>This project is my first contact with AWS and went completely wrong. I directly contacted the support and hoped that I can be helped. I hoped they could give me a refund.<p>The whole ticket was opened on 01.06.2021 and closed on 10.06.2021. 9 days I hoped that I could be helped. At the end they apologized for the waiting time, but they could not offer me a solution.<p>For me as a self-employed person it is a disaster, since it is my fault.<p>- What would have happened if the infinite loop, would cost $10,000 per day? When would AWS respond? For every credit, no matter how small, the credit rating is checked, why can I incur unlimited costs with AWS?<p>- What can I do better in the future and more importantly, how can I prevent that costs could rise unlimited?<p>- Is there a way to turn off all services at once?",web/mobile,devops/OS,devops/OS

We&#x27;re Taylor, Colton, and Jason, the founders of Hedgehog (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hedgehog.app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hedgehog.app</a>). We&#x27;re building a portfolio manager to help you learn about, keep track of, and trade cryptocurrency in one place.<p>We track 2000+ actively traded currencies across 550+ wallets, aggregate data from 20 different providers, and support trading on 130+ exchanges. This helps users make informed choices about investments and find the best prices across exchanges, with price differences as high as 0.5%. We also combine live usage data with detailed research on how each coin works, so you can see for yourself why a coin could be valuable--or not.<p>We know that HN tends to be divided on cryptocurrency-related topics, with some people interested and involved and others skeptical or critical. Obviously we find ourselves in the prior camp, but we also completely agree that the excessive hype and outright scams are a problem. Somebody has already created a scam token with our name on it!<p>As early team members at Acorns (the mobile app that invests your spare change), we helped simplify traditional investing and hope to bring that same level of transparency, clarity, and rigor to cryptocurrency.<p>We first got into this space in 2017. We were running a small consulting agency when three of our clients broke their contracts in the same month: one went bankrupt, one got sued by an ex-partner, and one was based in Alabama and decided that because we were in California they simply didn&#x27;t have to pay us. We lost $30k that month.<p>That&#x27;s when we learned about Ethereum and smart contracts, and a light bulb went off. Price and volatility aside, if we simply could have used a smart contract where money is automatically deposited upon project completion, we would have ensured payment.<p>But getting into cryptocurrency is complicated, painful, and it leaves new users particularly vulnerable. Taylor once spent $20k worth of ETH on fees, simply because of a bad interface. Add in secret keys and exchange hacks and you quickly find yourself in chaos. And yet, over half of cryptocurrency owners report that it was their very first investment, ever--and their most commonly used tracking tool is Excel.<p>That’s why we built Hedgehog, to give you fine-tuned control over your portfolio: our average client trades on at least 3 exchange accounts and automatically syncs balances across more than 10 different wallets. You can also group your assets into stacks like “Banking” or “Ethereum Tokens”, apply investing strategies, and even set up a rebalance calculator to help you distribute your funds based on live metrics like market cap, daily active addresses, or transaction volume.<p>We&#x27;re already helping individuals and investment firms manage $40 million in cryptocurrency, and we are acquiring the necessary financial licenses to offer a custodial wallet that connects users directly with the best price. You will no longer need to connect your own exchanges and wallets, we’ll manage multiple currencies across multiple exchanges for you. This allows us to earn revenue by making our own markets and keeping some of the difference between prices offered by buyers and sellers.<p>Love it or hate it, the fact that there&#x27;s over $48 trillion in annual cryptocurrency exchange volume at this point makes it unlikely to go away, and there&#x27;s a ton of work to be done in wrangling it into some sort of level playing field that makes sense to people.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear what you think, even if it’s just “this market shouldn’t exist in the first place.” If you&#x27;re active in cryptocurrency (or want to be), we&#x27;d love to have you as a user and are dying to ship features you want.

114,2021-06-11,Launch HN: Slingshow (YC W20) – Easily build custom virtual events and webinars,"Hello world, my name is Nilay. My cofounder Jorge and I founded Slingshow (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slingshow.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slingshow.com&#x2F;</a>) and we&#x27;re super excited (and nervous!) to finally launch on HN. Slingshow helps you build custom virtual events for your community. Think Zoom, but with a modern and flexible user experience that seamlessly flows between different ways of interacting with larger and smaller groups.<p>Last year, we were in YC W20 pivoting through several ideas, but then the pandemic hit. Suddenly, our YC batch was just a series of monotonous Zoom calls. We lost the magic of the social dinners, random conversations, and catching a speaker afterward for a personal chat. We quickly recognized that while Zoom was great for small meetings, the functionality and UI&#x2F;UX made large group events unorganized and passive.<p>During the pandemic, many novel and sometimes gimmicky video platforms emerged targeting the social niche. But every organization hosts more than social events. We built Slingshow to have no learning curve for traditional use cases like panels and presentations while seamlessly incorporating newer social formats. We think the best virtual event formats are still in their infancy and are unique to every use case, so we wanted to create a flexible tool that would let organizers build their own experiences.<p>We were inspired by companies like Notion, Coda, Retool, and Airtable, which work in the UI&#x2F;UX paradigm of creating functional modular building blocks. This means choosing a few simple, valuable abstractions like a table or a button and letting users mix and match these components to meet their needs. In our case, we’re starting with four fundamental blocks that organizers use to plan a schedule: Tables for free-flowing networking like interactions, Rooms for concurrent presentations, a Stage for classic webinar like presentations, and a Call to Action block for redirecting to external websites like forms, activities, etc.<p>Using our blocks, one of our enterprise customers (Fivetran) holds their standard webinar on our Stage block and then shifts into the Rooms block where attendees can choose to speak with the panelists. Another customer held a dating event that started with a Stage to introduce the event, then switched to Tables of 4, then 3, then 2 with different prompts to create more intimate conversations. We also have other customers hosting unique product launches, happy hours, live podcasts, cohort-based classes, and multi-day hackathons. While some platforms offer similar functionality, they’re heavy conference platforms with a large learning curve. They also require days of work to create specialized assets and often involve trained intermediaries like event organizers and planners.<p>We’re not focused on conferences but rather on simplicity, and Blocks help us achieve that. They&#x27;re versatile and help simplify the organizer&#x27;s event creation process by hiding complexity. Blocks are also a simple way for us to add new formats in the future. By just by creating a schedule with Blocks, Slingshow automatically generates the event page with registration, a cover image, and the entire attendee experience. Add a logo and brand color, and we&#x27;ll automatically theme the entire event to make it feel like your brand.<p>We&#x27;ve chosen to launch late as nothing else matters if the video isn&#x27;t stable and reliable for first-time users. One speaker failing to connect could ruin an event leaving a bad impression on everyone involved. We’ve spent several months working with early customers to gracefully handle errors and give helpful error messages for all the complexity of video: weak network connections, old browsers, mobile devices, firewalls, SDK edge cases, permission issues, etc. Depending on the use case, we also switch between multiple WebRTC video infrastructure providers. And lastly, following the lead of companies like Discord and Tandem, we built our backend using the Phoenix framework in Elixir because of its excellent support for WebSockets.<p>We still have a long way to go, but we feel confident with what we have and are ready to open up to a broader audience. We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and experiences with the many virtual events you&#x27;ve probably experienced over this pandemic.

On the one hand, there are legitimate reasons why eye doctors and their patients are tied to a physical office, and they mostly center on bulky hardware limitations (e.g. the slit lamp biomicroscope.) On the other hand, there are actually few legitimate reasons healthy people without eye disease need to be making routine in-office visits. In fact, the American Association of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends that folks with healthy eyes, good vision, and no risk factors for eye disease get a comprehensive exam just once in their 20s and twice in their 30s.<p>With this context, it’s absolutely wild that while millions of people are overexposed to eyecare via unnecessary pupillary dilations and air puff tests (which by the way are wildly inaccurate,) millions more can’t access even basic eyecare services, including refractions (aka the measurement of one’s eye prescription.) After all, 24% of U.S. counties have no optometrists or ophthalmologists!<p>Online eye exams are a first step toward addressing this pervasive access and resource allocation problem. We’re building our own version (feel free to play around with the prototype but please <i>access via deskop&#x2F;laptop only</i>: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.quadranteye.com&#x2F;va&#x2F;creditcard"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.quadranteye.com&#x2F;va&#x2F;creditcard</a>) which is an asynchronous exam that assesses your vision and eye health; the exam results, along with a glasses&#x2F;contact lens prescription uploaded by the patient, always get reviewed by an offsite MD&#x2F;OD. Our online exam is live and we&#x27;ve been renewing prescriptions for a few weeks now!<p>Unfortunately, online eye exams are limited in their scope and utility -- for one, they are unable to measure essential eye vitals such as pupillary response and eye pressure. These exams also happen to be extremely controversial, especially since they disrupt the traditional &quot;go into the eye doctor&#x27;s office, renew your prescription, buy your glasses&#x2F;contacts from your eye doctor&quot; model. For evidence that the $18B domestic optical industry stirs up strong emotions, check out this previous HN thread: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21653437"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21653437</a> (and dang tells us there have been many others!)<p>We believe online eye exams are a good catalyst for change, but they are definitely just a stepping stone. We’ve got our eyes on a much bigger vision — true at-home eyecare, including the ability to measure eye vitals — and we’re excited to have everyone follow along!<p>Thanks for reading and see you in the comments below. :)<p>Cheers,

This seemed to be kind of a personal &quot;trademark&quot; and he had apparently looked that way for some years already.<p>As part of his speech, maybe a speech about math and programming or math and Python, he told a personal anecdote that goes roughly like this:<p>He used to teach on a reservation and he lent a math book of his own to a Native teenage boy and the boy got beat up real bad and quit school, apparently over having accepted the math book from a White man and taken it home to read it. The boy returned the book to him at some point.<p>Years later, he noticed funny stuff in the margins and was able to identify it as the boy&#x27;s Native language and found a way to translate it and the boy was grateful for having read the book in spite of the high price he had paid for doing so.<p>I think the Native boy referred to the speaker telling this story as something like &quot;Two Beards&quot; in his notes in the book.<p>This may have been a keynote speech.<p>I spent maybe an hour looking for it last night and I&#x27;m stumped.

160,2021-06-14,Why Would Severe Chronic Pain Evolve?,"I&#x27;m suffering a flare-up of sciatica at the moment. So &#x27;enjoying&#x27; a week or more of barely being able to walk the length of the room and unable to get any sleep. As I lie awake at night, constantly fidgeting to try and find a comfortable position to try and doze off, I ask myself:<p>What is the point of severe chronic pain? As in &#x27;why would it have evolved?&#x27;I can see no biological advantage to it.<p>With sudden acute pain there&#x27;s an obvious sense the body is trying to protect itself from injury.<i>&quot;Move hand away from hot thing&quot;, &quot;Move leg away from spiky thing&quot;</i> etc. And with tolerable levels of ongoing chronic pain, the body is again trying to protect itself by reminding us through that ache in a limb [for example], to go easy on that body part, as its still healing from a previous injury. Which all makes perfect sense.<p>But what about higher levels of chronic pain? Anyone who&#x27;s had sciatica will know it can last for weeks and be absolutely agonising for days on end. What evolutionary benefit is my body gaining from that?<p>I can barely walk at the moment which, in our wilder ancestry would make me extremely vulnerable to becoming somebody&#x27;s dinner. I hardly ate for 2 days, when it was at its peak and I&#x27;m hardly getting any sleep at the moment. All of which seems intended to make my body more vulnerable, rather than protect it. [Another example of a similar affliction involving this kind of ongoing agony would be severe toothache].<p>So, again, why has such a setup evolved? Why has evolution ended up with a system whereby a tiny minor injury to an insignificant body part can cause the whole system to almost grind to a halt with unbearable levels of pain that seems unending. When a tolerable ache would serve just as well as a reminder to treat the injured area with caution.<p>Generally interested in reading some scientific theories on this.

Assume that such person has no idea of the current trends of sales software.<p>If someone asked me the same question for a software tech stack, I would answer for example:<p>- Bitbucket &#x2F; Github for version control<p>- Travis CI for continuous integration deployment<p>- React JS for front-end, combined with parcel as a bundler, Mobx State Tree for state management, etc.<p>- Ruby on Rails for back-end, combined with PostgreSQL.<p>Ideally, if you have information on how that product &#x2F; strategy gives you some advantage it would be really hepful.

- Long-term - data can&#x27;t be trusted.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear people&#x27;s war stories and the methods&#x2F;tech used to escape.<p>My thoughts are:
1. Track scripting
2. Catalogue reasons for scripting
3. Address the functionality gap that will remove the most common reason for scripting
4. Remove access to tables users were updating via SQL before functionality gaps were filled
5. Continue 1-4 until done",web/mobile,general,job/career
46,2021-06-09,Ask HN: In what scenario can a company legally remove your equity?,"Hi!<p>I recently quitted a startup that I spent many years at. I was the first employee as engineer, and I own equity (not option). The management team has changed drastically over the years, and the tech that enabled the business is now considered a cost. The politics got overwhelming, which is why I quitted. The startup has made a few private rounds and added many members to the board. The management does not like tech at all. They offered a price for my shares, which I said no because of the low offer. And I received a message from the management saying my shares are restricted and subject to board cancelation.<p>I cannot tell if it is an unhappy&#x2F;unreasonable threat message from the management or if it can actually be possible.

Even at this earlier stage, the compiler is a joy to use (and I am trying to do as much &quot;dog-fooding&quot; as possible, in parallel to improving the compiler).<p>I want this to be an open-source project but, at the same time, I would like to find out ways to keep working on it and sustain myself and my family.<p>Target audience: By my estimates, this new language may be useful (for research, or at least for teaching) for ~1000 people working in this field (assuming that they will accept some small amount of learning, of course). It might also be relevant to a few HPC hardware-vendors, because I am generating accelerator-aware code from one of the backends -- I am fine if they use my code to showcase their hardware, as long as they give something back :). It might also be interesting for people who are just curious about this field.<p>So, my questions are:<p>(1) What are some possible revenue-streams for supporting the continuous development of a programming language, while keeping it open-source? I think I demonstrated by now that I am willing to work on this for free. However, it would be nice not to worry also about a &quot;real&quot; job.<p>The open-source part is quite important, because (more than funding) I want people to use this language. Also, I hope to attract some developers for things like IDE integration, making amazing (Elm-style) error-messages, etc. I am also doing my best to cover these areas, but worrying about these things is no longer a one-man job.<p>(2) Which open-source license would you recommend in this case?<p>P.S: I plan to submit another message here soon, to announce the official release.",web/mobile,general,job/career

Then, I moved to the management role. It turns out it is very hard to operate when you have dysfunctional team.

166,2021-06-14,Ask HN: Why does archive.is track who reads submitted content via DNS,"Does anyone know why archive.is tracks who has read an article.  If we look at the HTML from archive.is we see they include an image link to a domain name that contains the user&#x27;s IP address.  Popular browsers not only run arbitrary Javascript by default, they also access image links by default.  Thus the archive.is DNS server has a record of every time the page is viewed in one of these browsers (and the domain name is not cached).  This includes the IP address of the person who retrieved the page.<p><pre><code>    &lt;img style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;[ipaddr].[country].ABCD.1234567890.pixel.archive.is&#x2F;x.gif&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
It seems some HN commenters have a preference for sharing links to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is</a> as a way of avoiding Javascript obfuscation of text (so-called &quot;paywalls&quot;).<p>The text being obfuscated is public, available to anyone, not only to subscribers.  It is not password-protected.  The website developer using the &quot;paywall&quot; technique simply tries to annoy the user into subscribing by obfuscating the text using Javascript.  This only works if the user runs Javascript from the website.  Popular browsers, most of them funded by advertising, run arbitrary Javascript by default, however Javascript can be disabled by by anyone by simply changing default settings.  Most users do not change default settings.  Most users use the same small number of popular browsers.<p>When we refrain from running Javascript and accessing image links automatically, the web becomes more readable and less annoying. We can choose a browser that is simpler than the popular ones and does fewer things automatically without user input, e.g., running Javascript and loading images.",web/mobile,finance,web/mobile

207,2021-06-16,Launch HN: Svix (YC W21) – Webhooks as a Service,"Hey everyone, my name is Tom, and I&#x27;m the founder of Svix (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svix.com</a>) - previously known as Diahook. Svix makes it easy for developers to send webhooks from their service using a simple API. Think Twilio or SendGrid but for webhooks.<p>Webhooks are how servers notify each other of events, so they are a key component of many APIs such as Stripe, Shopify, Slack, Dropbox and Github.
They look easy to implement (just a POST request), but they come with a variety of challenges. For example, customer endpoints fail or hang much more often than you would think, so you would need to implement retries. You need to make sure such failures don&#x27;t clog your send queue or the rest of your system. The webhook system is an additional system separate from your normal web server that needs to be scaled and monitored separately. There are also a variety of security implications such as SSRF, replay attacks, and attackers sending fake webhooks to your customers (so make sure to sign the payload and make it easy to verify!). You also want to avoid overloading your users&#x27; endpoints, so you want to automatically rate-limit webhook sending, as well as disabling failing ones, and notifying your users when you do.<p>I encountered these challenges at my previous company. Our users were constantly asking us for webhooks, but we kept deferring building them because we weren&#x27;t willing to commit the engineering time, resources, and ongoing maintenance required of a webhook delivery system. This was the seed for Svix, but it&#x27;s only after a friend of mine asked about adding webhooks to her own product that I realized &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s maybe a business here&quot;.<p>The idea behind Svix is to make it very easy for everyone to send webhooks. Developers make one API call and we take care of deliverability, monitoring, and retries.
We also have a pre-built management UI that our customers can offer their users to manage their webhook endpoints, as well as inspect, debug, and replay failures.
This is in addition to a variety of tools, libraries, and tutorials to make both sending and consuming webhooks easy.<p>We have previously done a Show HN (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26399672"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26399672</a>) and got a lot of great feedback from the community.
A lot has changed since then, for example, we now have libraries for Python, JavaScript (TypeScript), Java and Go; a first version of the Ruby and PHP libraries, and a CLI for interacting with the service.
We have improved the management UI, made it easy to embed it in an iframe, and improved the onboarding and documentation to make it even easier to get started.
And finally, we have scaled the backend to keep up with the growing needs of our customers.
We have a lot more planned for the coming months, and we&#x27;ve grown the team so improvements are going to come at an even higher pace.<p>One of the common questions from our Show HN was: &quot;Don&#x27;t developers need to handle deliverability and retries to Svix?&quot;
Deliverability to user endpoints (servers) is very different to deliverability to Svix.
User endpoints fail all the time and for various reasons, and each of them can fail independently.
This means developers need a robust and scalable delivery system that can deal with failures on an ongoing basis.
While with Svix, outages are rare, and are dealt with as incidents. The same way you would with SendGrid, Twilio and other API providers.<p>Our goal with Svix is to make it easier for developers to add webhooks to their service. Webhooks make APIs that much more useful and enable a lot of automations and integrations which benefit both the products offering them, and the communities around them. Just think of all the cool Slack bots made possible thanks to webhooks. I&#x27;d really love to see every service out there offering a great API!<p>I&#x27;d love to hear about your experience building (or using) webhooks systems. What&#x27;s a must have?

7,2021-06-07,Ask HN: Ever seen two companies share a domain?,"When I was in college I was helping a small business set up a website. The business&#x27;s name was long. The obvious .com domain name, while available, would have been unwieldy to type in an email. The owner often abbreviated the company&#x27;s name with three letters, and wondered if we could have the three-letter domain &quot;.com.&quot; Of course, that domain was already in use, to which he asked, &quot;can we have it too?&quot;<p>I asked what he wanted people to see when they typed in the web address. On the one hand, every millennial has stories of explaining how the internet works to impatient, older people. He was especially scandalized (and I don&#x27;t think he fully believed me) when he learned what registered domain names generally cost. Remembering that conversation now has me thinking... the internet is a weird place full of ad-hoc cooperative arrangements. In the age of JSON-LD schemas, well-known URLs, and EXTERNAL SENDER warnings, perhaps no corporation with a significant digital strategy will stomach sharing a domain.

27,2021-06-08,Launch HN: Runway (YC W21) – Easier iOS and Android app releases for teams,"Hi HN!<p>I’m Gabriel, one of the co-founders of Runway (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runway.team"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runway.team</a>). We’re building a SaaS platform that makes it easier to coordinate your team’s mobile app releases. Runway is an integration layer that sits on top of mobile app teams’ existing project management and development tools, making it possible to understand at-a-glance the status and progress of release cycles and to communicate tasks and blockers — allowing teams to spend their time on improving their product instead of managing releases and tooling.<p>When I was an iOS engineer, my team rotated everyone through the release manager role for each release cycle. I remember dreading the weeks I was assigned this role - I’d get stuck spending a few hours with multiple Chrome tabs open checking on the status of different tools, killing time while waiting for builds to upload, Slacking the owners of various tasks, and referring back to a 40-line spreadsheet that was often out of date. . I also felt out of practice each time it was my turn - it was hard to remember the sequence of stuff that needed doing, and there weren’t any guardrails to guide me through the process again. New additions to the team felt even more lost when it was their first couple of turns in the role!<p>If anything, the problem has worsened over time as mobile apps became first-class platforms at lots of companies, and tech orgs naturally started to grow those development teams and implement more robust and complex toolchains to support them — but much of the process of coordinating those people and tools in order to release regularly has remained frustratingly ad hoc.<p>While some build-centric tasks can be automated (e.g. using fastlane or scripts), we see that a lot of the overhead of releases is actually very people-centric: keeping your PM up to date on progress, looping in marketing for release notes, or syncing with QA on the status of regression testing. We also noticed that, even with a solid CI&#x2F;CD pipeline in place, there are often still lots of manual tasks along the way - build selection, branching and tagging, compiling changelogs, pinging the right people with status and updates, etc.<p>We built Runway to connect all those dots. It pulls in all Jira tickets and code relevant to the release, side-by-side, to surface and resolve any out-of-sync tickets or code. You can set up custom, interactive checklists with item-specific owners to replace the monster Google spreadsheet, and our Slack integration will ping the appropriate people or notify everyone when important milestones happen. Design&#x2F;marketing can enter ‘What’s New’ release notes directly in Runway for all localizations (with a handy list of new features in the release to reference) without you having to hunt them down. Plus, Runway helps teams maintain good workflow hygiene by automatically tagging releases in GitHub and applying missing labels to Jira tickets.<p>Typically, tasks like these represent lost time that adds up quickly and silently for teams and release managers, between context-switching, monitoring jobs for completion and waiting to get someone’s attention on Slack (all of which only gets harder as teams become more distributed with remote work). In talking to lots of companies, we’ve also noticed that some larger orgs eventually try to build something like Runway in-house, but at a steep cost of dedicated engineers, time, and recurring maintenance.<p>Runway is made for any team building and shipping mobile apps – we currently support both iOS and Android, and have built-in support for OTA (over-the-air) deploys as well as SDK releases. And, we’re language and framework agnostic: whether you write in Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java, or use a framework like React Native, Expo, or Flutter, Runway has you covered. We envision Runway as a better way for most teams to manage the release process — one that can save an average-sized mobile team releasing bi-weekly about $50K a year.<p>We’re still experimenting with pricing strategy, but for now we’re charging a monthly subscription fee per app – there&#x27;s a lower tier to access most features, and a higher tier with added features is in the works.

5,2021-06-07,Show HN: InstaNote – notes in a simple chat interface,"(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instanote.io)<p>Hey HN, founder here. I announced this first on HN a few months ago that got a bunch of interest. It has grown a lot since then: I’ve made many improvements, added paid subscriptions, and the app hit 100k+ downloads on Android recently. There’s a growing list of subscribers supporting development.<p>This started as a iOS app to build what I personally wanted for these reasons:<p>* There are many tools for complex note taking and project organization, but they don’t make it easy for quickly noting down thoughts. I wanted a fast way to write something down, and an interface like chat seemed most appropriate. I’ve seen many people use chat apps to achieve these things in roundabout ways but they don’t support everything I wanted.<p>* Keeping track of things over time isn’t easy in other note-taking apps. InstaNote has threads and I personally use them to track my weight and pictures over time. Super easy to see trends.<p>* Most tools don’t have the flexibility of reminders that I wanted. InstaNote has one-time reminders + reminders repeating daily, weekly, monthly, with multiple snooze options. I have 10+ repeating reminders set for myself (this surprised me too!). All reminders can be ported to a new device when you login with one click.<p>* Everyone saves a ton of links. Without link previews (like those shown in chat apps), saved links are really hard to browse and find. InstaNote shows link previews which make browsing and searching a lot easier.<p>* Sharing notes also works great in a chat-like UI.<p>* CSV copy of notes: Subscribers get a CSV copy of their notes on email with one click in the app (available on Android, upcoming on iOS but emailing support@instanote.io will work in the meantime). I want users to use the product because they find it useful, not because their data is locked in.<p>Many app subscribers have given great feedback over the last couple of months. Would love to hear feedback from the community.",web/mobile,web/mobile,web/mobile
15,2021-06-07,Show HN: One flew over the variadic template arguments,"Python is a dynamically -- run-time -- typed language. That creates big advantages and big disadvantages. The advantage: it makes it very versatile and heterogeneously functional. For example, you could easily have heterogeneous containers. You could easily loop through them and your loop variable is dynamically evaluated. Also, you could have heterogeneous interfaces, …
The disadvantage: it is very inefficient. For example, in the above loop, the loop variable type must be determined at each iteration. That’s extremely inefficient -- although there are ways under certain circumstances to avoid that.<p>C++, on the other hand, is statically and moderately-strongly typed language. So, you cannot – without using pointers which is inefficient – have heterogeneous containers because you must know all types at compile time. Also, you cannot have heterogeneous interfaces, …
Enter the _ variadic template arguments_. This modern C++ feature makes it possible to have some aspects of heterogeneity without the disadvantage of inefficiency. Variadic template arguments help in designing interfaces for heterogeneous containers. 
As an example, please look at [DataFrame](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hosseinmoein&#x2F;DataFrame) which implements a C++ heterogeneous container. Look at member methods load_data()(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmlpreview.github.io&#x2F;?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hosseinmoein&#x2F;DataFrame&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;load_data.html), groupby()(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmlpreview.github.io&#x2F;?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hosseinmoein&#x2F;DataFrame&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;groupby.html), bucketize()(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmlpreview.github.io&#x2F;?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hosseinmoein&#x2F;DataFrame&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;bucketize.html).

40,2021-06-09,Ask HN: How can we make self-hosting cloud apps easy for non-technical users?,"Currently, it is impossible for non-technical users to install a web-based app (i.e. an app that runs on a server and delivered through a web browser).<p>It&#x27;s no wonder that SaaS continues to dominate the software market when the self-host alternative is so time-consuming and unfriendly to set-up.<p>Non-technical users know how to install desktop apps. Imagine if app installs on the server were as simple and easy as installing a desktop app? It would unlock countless opportunities for developers to reach more users.<p>There appears to be no appetite or interest in the industry to tackle this problem. Or is there?<p>I don&#x27;t consider Docker, Cloudtron, Sandstorm, command-line scripts as possible options. Developers may find them &#x27;easy&#x27;, but none of these options are easy or simple for non-technical users. Even one-click app marketplaces (Linode, Digital Ocean etc) have their complications.<p>Is the following a possibility? A common or standardised &#x27;installation&#x27; API for web apps adopted by web servers like Apache, NGINX, Caddy etc. The API covers security, permissions, installation location and even uninstallation. (I&#x27;m far too thick to figure out how it could be implemented, but one can dream.)<p>Without easy deployment for non-technical users, self-hosting will never be a viable option for most people, only for a tiny minority of technical users. If you disagree, take a look at the unstoppable juggernaut that is SaaS.<p>Relying on SaaS also brings with it the possibility of file and data lock-in (as well as privacy issues). Many developers warn of the dangers of this situation, and yet the industry has done nothing to tackle the issue. (Unfair?)<p>Would it be too cyncial to suggest that it&#x27;s in the best interest of SaaS providers that self-hosting remain complicated because it makes SaaS a more atttractive, less complicated alternative?<p>So, how can we make self-hosting cloud apps easy for non-technical users?",web/mobile,general,web/mobile

I know this use case might not be applicable to many activities, but I think it would work great for some.<p>For example, a tennis pro could create a schedule of time slots that they are available to teach. A person would sign up for a lesson time slot. If they realized that they needed a different time slot but the schedule was full, they could post a message to the &quot;program&quot; participants (program could be all users in that tennis pro&#x27;s schedule for the same day or next few days).

186,2021-06-15,Launch HN: Axolo (YC W21) – Faster pull requests and code reviews,"Hi HN!<p>We’re Arthur and Sydney (cosydney). We’re building Axolo (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axolo.co"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axolo.co</a>) a bidirectional Github-Slack integration to help tech teams reduce pull request time and improve code review’s feedback.<p>Sydney and I met in 42, a software engineering school in Paris, and started working together on different tech projects last year. While working on our last business, a SaaS management platform for SMEs, we were in a squad of 4 to 5 people and often found ourselves writing direct messages in Slack about pull requests. We were telling each other things like ‘Hey Arthur, I’ve updated my last pull request feature&#x2F;zoom_integration, do you have time to check it out soon?’ or “it’s been two days, do you have time to review feature&#x2F;user_settings today, here is the link: github&#x2F;axolo-co&#x2F;api.axolo.co&#x2F;pull&#x2F;381?”. It was messy, took time and mental load to contextualize each pull request to each other.<p>We talked to over 100 companies about how they ship code. Here is the most common pattern:  An engineer creates a pull request and asks someone or a dedicated team to review it. Notifications are poorly handled and people often ping again directly. Then, comments are made on Github and if a disagreement appears, the conversation goes on a voice call or in Slack.<p>This approach has two major problems. (1) Dangling pull requests are waste of time and a source of frustration for developers. They cause the code development process to slow down and prevent developers from focusing on a new task ahead. It’s difficult to dive back into a pull request you submitted two days ago. (2) Feedback on code is hard to convey between one developer to another. It can be misinterpreted or even worse: not given at all.<p>The ideal solution doesn’t need a new tool in our daily routine. Having in mind that most of the friction was in context-switching between Github and Slack, we decided to build a bridge between those two.<p>So we developed Axolo as a bi-directional Github-Slack integration. Each pull request creates a temporary Slack channel where Github notifications are sent (comments, reviews, actions &amp; deployments). The creator, reviewers, and assignees are invited to that channel. Then when the pull request is either closed or merged, we save the conversation as documentation in the Github pull request and archive the channel.<p>We&#x27;re not only a code review notification center. We consider each pull request as a small independent project where all people that take a part in it will be invited. Here’s a demo video (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;aoOZNGdBKlY"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;aoOZNGdBKlY</a>) of how it works, if you want to take a glance at our main features.<p>Our public beta started three weeks ago. To sign up on Axolo, you need to install our Github app on your organization (we do not have access to your code) and our Slack app. Most of our features are free for everyone, but if you’re looking for specific settings &amp; analytics, the professional plan is 8$&#x2F; engineer &#x2F; month that you can try (you don&#x27;t have to enter a credit card upfront).<p>We know the Hacker News community is full of many engineers with deep experiences in code reviewing (and code shipping!) and we look forward to receiving your feedback on our work.

E.g. &quot;Show me events that start at 6pm and end by 10pm.&quot;<p>* Nearby Cities: Results will often display events in nearby cities, despite the User specifying that they only want to see &quot;nearby events&quot;. This makes the search results essentially unusable, since much of what is displayed is not appropriate to you.<p>...and yet, FB events are often the only game in town.<p>Honestly, I am quite suspicious of Facebook&#x27;s reasons for making these UI and UX decisions, since no self-respecting UI&#x2F;UX designer would come up with this interface or this experience. Maybe Facebook believes that if you&#x27;re attending in-person events, then you aren&#x27;t using Facebook?<p>I would truly love to see FB improve the UI and UX of the Events API so that Users could find more appropriate results for their searches.",web/mobile,general,web/mobile

222,2021-06-17,Help HN: Insane Google Cloud Issues,"I have a somewhat dystopian Google situation and am coming here to HN after running out of other options. I&#x27;m hoping someone at Google Cloud reads this or someone someone can refer this to someone at Google Cloud.<p>I&#x27;ve recently been engaged by a client to help them build out their Google Cloud infrastructure. I&#x27;ve been a DevOps consultant for 10+ years but usually prefer AWS due to issues I&#x27;ve had to GCP in the past. But this particular client was using them already, so that&#x27;s what we are going with.<p>This client has an account setup with a few projects running within the free tier. We are now ready to deploy a more mature development environment (Mostly GKE and CloudSQL) that will take us out of the free tier limits. We&#x27;ve added billing information to the account and even made a $500 payment in advance.<p>When trying to deploy however we still hit quota limits. The error gives a URL at which quota limit increases can be requested. When trying to do so however the console gives an error message saying the account is not eligible for a quota limit increase and asks us to contact sales.<p>The sales contact page it gives us has a form, a chatbot and a phone number. Calling the default phone number reveals that it is out of service. The chat bot is broken, and after collecting your contact info it resets and goes blank. The form seems to work but then I never receive the promised case email.<p>We were finally able to get through to a sales or support person in the Philippines after trying the Swiss support number instead of the American one (Which is out of service). That person didn&#x27;t seem to know much but claimed they&#x27;d lifted the quota restriction on the account. Of course they didn&#x27;t, and the issue remains.<p>I&#x27;m worried if we try to start over with a brand new account it will look even more suspicious to Google and we&#x27;ll get perma-banned or something.

The problem arrives when I’ve read the font page for the day and then keep coming back to refresh the page or browse the new queue.<p>I’ve tried deleting the HN icon from Safari’s top sites list (I’m a strict iPhone-only poster here).  That worked for a few days until I started to type in “news.y…” in the address bar manually (and then another HN page ended up in my frequently-visited list).<p>What got me off Reddit was boredom or exhaustion from the repetitive discussions.  The addictive points about HN right now for me are the novelty (I’m still finding interesting discussions and not yet mentally autofilling the expected comments on every post I read) and the civility culture (which means that the arguments aren’t Twitter-tier name-calling, so long as there isn’t someone to show up to rant about the evils of socialism on a tangentially-related thread).<p>If I had better Wi-Fi in my office, I could just blackhole HN from my PiHole.

261,2021-06-19,The ORM and SQL issue we have,"Hello everyone, good morning from the Himalayas.<p>There was a post yesterday about an ORM and there was the obvious debate on why ORMs overall are a bad thing. I had posted that the experience of ORM varies by language. A language needs to support run-time manipulation of the definitions of schema to then allow shuttling of data from native types in that language to SQL.<p>But it does not stop there. If you use a query builder it goes a long way, sure. If  you write SQL, it is a lot worse. What happens when your data is the source of truth for building rich query experience? Say we have 12 types of taxononmy (Size, Region, Price, Supplier, ...) and the user can filter dynamically? Also your environment (where is the user currently querying from) determines the set filters.<p>This is not easy to solve directly with SQL. How do you loop over all the incoming filters? How you extract data coming in from HTTP requests and bind them to an SQL query? Manually write each possible combination? This falls apart quickly and we need a better abstraction for SQL itself, not the underlying data. SQL was created for database users to sit and type out queries. The query parameters were known at the time of typing the SQL. This is mostly NOT how it is used in (backend) applications. SQL is being dynamically generated all the time. So the (backend) application strives to have a complete understanding of the model, relations, data types, constraints.<p>There are other advantages when you have the entire data definition in your programming language: CRUD becomes easier. Migrations also can be written in the programming language instead of SQL, although I have always appreciated writing SQL migrations too.<p>I really hope the community keeps experimenting and trying new ways to implement ORMs or something totally new - we need this.

We are building a recommender system. I see 2 options for creating training dataset(joining with ground truth labels). I would like to get feedback from developers regarding usage of Feature Store in this regard.<p>Option 1:<p>1) We can log all the features from prediction API. 
UniqueResponseId, feature1, feature 2 
We can pass UniqueResponseId in response and then it would be logged when customers take action to this response. 
UniqueResponseId, response1.<p>Then we can join these 2 data to form training dataset, 
UniqueResponseId, feature1, feature2, ..., action1 .<p>This approach seems like perfect as we are able to get exact features and their corresponding actions.<p>Option 2:
We can have time travel in Feature Store. Time travel allows to get features at certain point of time. 
The approach would be:
We log, 
responseId, time1 from prediction API. 
When customer takes action, we log
responseId, action1<p>Then we do: 
getTime(responseId) returns time1
getFeatures(time1) ==&gt; return feature 0, feature 1
join on responseId
responseId, feature0, feature1, action1<p>This approach is complex and there are other disadvantages if features are changing rapidly as  it is impossible to get exact features used during serving. The features can only be approximated in this option.<p>I am unsure if I should go with Option 2. Option1 seems like intuitive choice.

Some of the gProfiler benefits:<p>- Seamless installation with no code changes<p>- Immediate visibility into production code (&lt;5 min.)<p>- Minimal performance overhead and less than 1% utilization penalty<p>- Native support for Java, Go, Python, Scala, Clojure, PHP , and Kotlin<p>With this new feature, gProfiler users can now filter services based on Container name, Hostname, or K8s object. This means that you can view a flame graph of what you want to investigate from a specific container host or pod. 
To get started, all you have to do is follow these simple steps:<p>- Create your gProfiler account (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;profiler.granulate.io&#x2F;)<p>- Add a new service using our installation wizard  using a Daemonset installation<p>- Inspect your profiling data and start optimizing<p>You can also play around and see how it works in our demo application(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo-profiler.granulate.io&#x2F;). Click on the filters icon and see how the graph filters accordingly.<p>BTW - We’ve also added support for profiling PHP using phpspy, in addition to our existing support for Java, Python and Go, and more.",web/mobile,general,web/mobile
92,2021-06-11,Survey on funding of open-source projects,"Hello everyone!<p>I have seen a lot of discussions in the past about the sustainability of open-source development and how this can lead to burnout with some of the maintainers. However, these are individual voices and I would like to collect a broader understanding.<p>I want to start an initiative to improve the situation for maintainers and for this, your feedback would be really helpful.<p>If you are interested, you can find more information here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;survey.makemake.sh&#x2F;<p>Thank you very much!<p>Sebastian Hoitz",web/mobile,general,web/mobile

98,2021-06-11,Airbnb Support Is Shit,"I got bug bites at Airbnb. Doctor says its bed bugs. Host kicks me out same day leaving me stranded for the night and changes the locks, but says will refund. Next day he says he didn&#x27;t find any bed bugs, so he will not refund, oh and plus cleaning fees! Airbnb support is just going back and forth, doing nothing. The trip is still &quot;Current trip&quot; so I&#x27;m paying for a stay that I&#x27;m literally locked out of.<p>I am truly shocked by Airbnb&#x27;s incompetence and lack of real sympathy for guests. If I&#x27;m ever in serious trouble, I know I can&#x27;t count on them. All of their support is electronic... and S L O W.<p>They have little interest in truly helping guests. They offered NO material support when I informed them I had been locked out at night? How about providing a hotel for a night? -- even shitty airlines will do that!<p>For the bed bugs, they&#x27;re saying don&#x27;t book another airbnb- book a hotel, so your bugs can go to a hotel and not one of our listings. Do wash your clothes in high heat, and throw away everything else. And oh, just to be clear, we won&#x27;t be compensating you for anything you end up throwing out.<p>They made these conditions while suggesting they will refund me. After I agreed to the above, now they&#x27;re backtracking on the refund even.<p>Lesson learned: think twice before booking Airbnb!",web/mobile,general,web/mobile
89,2021-06-11,My final project is due one month from now and I don't have an idea,"Hey! Hope everyone is doing great today :)<p>Guys I have one month to think and implement a kickass idea that will show off my skills in front of a very important crowd of talent-seeking individuals.<p>I need your help to think of a project!<p>My skills to work with:
- GraphQL
- Nodejs
- Puppeteer&#x2F;Cheerio web scraping over tor.
- React.js
- MongoDB, mySQL
- AWS<p>What do I like?<p>- Backend stuff over frontend, but enjoy all.
- Something that might be useful for people, that would have value.
- Something impressive to the potential employer.<p>What I&#x27;ve done:<p>- A Spotify clone that is based on web scrapers to get literally every song available on YouTube and stream it&#x27;s audio to your device - feels (and looks) just like real Spotify.<p>- A collaboration platform for open source projects with teams and resource sharing.<p>- A flexible web scraper capable of getting various inputs from multiple pages, depths and selectors, clicking elements, scraping whole forums including Tor websites, and getting real time alerts for any data received that is offensive, violent or illegal using my own NER and sentiment system.<p>What I&#x27;d do if I had the skills to do so:<p>- Probably a complete self-hosted email service that can be relatively off-grid.<p>Please help!

94,2021-06-11,Ask HN: Would it be educational to map error messages to common mistakes?,"This question is just a musing, a &quot;shower thought&quot; if you will.<p>I have a JS&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Java background (side projects can be much lower level though such as C++ or x86-64 ;-) ). I&#x27;m currently learning Go from Learn Go With Tests [1]. And I sometimes make silly mistakes such as testAdder instead of TestAdder (lowercase t vs capital T). In that example I got back &quot;testing: warning: no tests to run&quot;. I had to use a search engine to find out why. I don&#x27;t find it a big deal, but I am simply wondering if there is a more efficient way to deal with this problem of understanding &quot;cryptic&quot; error messages when you&#x27;re starting out in a new language.<p>So, might it be useful to have a site for programmers starting out in a new language that could give potential causes when a particular error message is displayed?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quii.gitbook.io&#x2F;learn-go-with-tests&#x2F;go-fundamentals&#x2F;integers",web/mobile,web/mobile,web/mobile

1325,"Where they get you is that it very rarely makes financial sense to do both cloud and colo&#x2F;on-prem (unless you&#x27;re a massive company).  It ends up being way more expensive to use the cloud, but also hire engineers to work on making an on-prem cloud.  Most companies have a mixed bag of projects that are either better served by the cloud, or are okay with colo and the savings it can bring.<p>Assuming you don&#x27;t want to do a hybrid approach, then you either push everyone onto the cloud and accept paying more, or you push everyone into colo and force the small and scaling out projects to deal with stuff like having to order hardware 3 months in advance.<p>Then, depending on how nice you want it to be to interact with your infrastructure, you can end up paying a lot to have people build abstractions over it.  Do you want developers to be able to create their own database from a merge request or API call?  If so, now you&#x27;re going to have to hire someone with a 6 figure salary to figure out how to do that.  It&#x27;s easy to forget how many things are involved in that.  You&#x27;re going to have a lot of databases, so you need a system to track them.  A lot of these databases are presumably not big enough to warrant a full physical server, so you have to sort out multi-tenancy.  If you have multi-tenancy, you need a way to handle RBAC so one user can&#x27;t bork all the databases on the host.  You will also need some way to handle what happens when one user is throwing so much load at the RDBMS it&#x27;s impacting other apps on that database.  To accomplish that, you&#x27;re going to need a way to gather metrics that are sharded per-database and a way to monitor those (which is admittedly one of the easier bits).  You also generally just straight up lose a lot of the scaling features.  I don&#x27;t have a way to just give you more IOPS to your database on-prem.  The best I can do is add more disks, but your database will be down for a long time if I have to put a disk in, expand the RAID, let it redistribute data and then power it back up.  That&#x27;s several hours of downtime for you, along with anyone who&#x27;s on the same database.  Of course, we can do replicas, and swap the master, but everyone will have to reconfigure their apps or we need something like Consul to handle that (which means more engineers to manage that stuff).<p>You&#x27;re also probably going to need more than one of those expensive infra people, because they presumably need an on-call rotation, and no one is going to agree to be on-call the time.  And every time someone quits, you have to train the new person, which is several months of salary basically wasted.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that you don&#x27;t need infra people on AWS, but you a) need a lot less of them, because they only need to manage the systems AWS has, not build them, and b) you can hire cheaper ops people, again because you don&#x27;t need people that are capable of building those kinds of systems.<p>Once you factor in all of that stuff, AWS&#x27; prices start looking more reasonable.  They&#x27;re still a little higher, but they&#x27;re not double the price.  If anything more than a tiny, tiny subset of the AWS features are appealing, it&#x27;s going to cost you almost as much to build your own as it does to just pay Amazon&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;whoever.<p>Also, a massive thing people overlook is that AWS is fairly well documented.  I can Google exactly how to set up permissions on an S3 bucket, or how to use an S3 bucket as a website.  It only takes seconds, the cognitive burden is low, and the low-friction doesn&#x27;t cause anyone stress.  In-house systems tend to be poorly documented, and doing anything slightly outside the norm becomes a &quot;set up a meeting with the infra team&quot; kind of thing.

Needing an established trust-path between users seems like a large obstacle in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>You are right, these are disadvantages but other than &quot;trust paths&quot; the complexity can be mitigated with:<p>1. Market makers who buy IOUs at a discount and swap them for _their_ IOU which can be more trusted. Essentially you want a little bit of centralisation around parties which are known to always make good on their liabilities. These parties could be fully automated (think like Ethereum DAO) and transparent. In some ways these market makers are like banks of today but instead of lending their credit into existence, like banks do, they require people to buy it (usually) at a premium.
2. Insurance or a credit derivatives market so people can hedge against counterparts defaults.
3. If everyone agrees on a common numeraire and wallets are sophisticated to show an aggregate balance in that numeraire taking into account credit risk then that could remove much of the complexity for users. Integrated with market makers, you could &quot;auto swap&quot; IOUs to issuers which you prefer. Wallets can also provide a credit risk break down on all counterparts. Agree this is more complicated than current notions of money.
4. Securitisation markets. Package up IOUs into tranches. Traders can speculate on various levels of credit quality.
5. Sensible reputation management. Non-invasive performance tracking of debtors. Did they meet margin requirements? Did they meet all coupon payments? Etc. Can also take into account degree of co-operation with other users, for example do they accommodate restructuring and help others meet their liabilities?<p>I don&#x27;t like crypto because there&#x27;s essentially zero accountability for issuers and that kind of environment is optimal for scammers. Crypto behaves like synthetic equity&#x2F;commodity instruments with no accountable issuers. In contrast, with a credit based system, issuers are responsible for their issued liabilities and are expected to make good on them. In crypto, no-one thinks in terms of liabilities and so you get ridiculous projects like &quot;Synthentix&quot; who are collateralising a USD Stablecoins with their own issued tokens. For anyone with a basic understanding of financial risk and accounting, their approach is mad.<p>A credit based system is fairer because anyone can issue credit and the onus in on issuers to ensure they have the necessary reputation for others to accept their credit.

2984,"Nicholas has <i>Waded</i> (pun intended) into the waters of irrational horror over gain-of-function research that seems to <i>gain viral traction</i> following every spill-over event. The only argument presented in the article that leans towards the lab-leak hypothesis is the human-preffered double CGG codon that appears in the furin cleavage site; this is nothing like a smoking gun, IMO. Yesterday&#x27;s TWiV 751 covered a paper <i>The furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is required for transmission in ferrets</i> [1] which has the following abstract:<p>&gt; To investigate the importance of the spike polybasic CS of SARS-CoV-2 (PRRAR), a number of spike mutants predicted to modulate the efficiency of furin cleavage were generated (Fig. 1a), including: substituting two upstream arginines to produce a monobasic CS similar to SARS-CoV spike (monoCS), replacing the tribasic CS with the furin CS of a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza haemagglutinin containing seven basic amino acids (H5CS) and two naturally occurring deletions seen following passage in Vero E6 cells and&#x2F;or in clinical isolates21,26. The first deletion removes eight amino acids including all three arginines of the PRRAR site (ΔCS), while the other removes five flanking amino acids but retains the tribasic CS (Δflank). The mutations were engineered into a spike expression plasmid to enable cell surface expression and generation of coronavirus lentiviral PVs. In addition, to study the importance of the PRRAR motif in the context of live virus, we used a naturally occurring Vero-cell-adapted mutant SARS-CoV-2, ΔCS26. This variant and the wild-type (WT) virus from which it was derived were cloned by limiting dilution to enable studies using individual genotypes.<p>This is the <i>horror</i> of in vitro and in vivo viral lab research and the result is a magnificent advancement of our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the furin cleavage site, and its role in TMPRSS2 assisted membrane entry. This research follows the equally eye-opening paper covered in TWiV 715 that explained why hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) failed; Vero E6 cells lack TMPRRS2 so HCQ fully blocks entry via endocytosis. It should be noted that this study includes MERS-CoV which also has a furin cleavage site; falsifying one of the claims of Wade&#x27;s article.<p>Regardless, lab experiments begin with one or more viral isolates and molecular clock techniques should show that the original Wuhan variant has almost identical non-coding genome segments compared to existing lab isolates. The RaTG13 sequence is a very distant relative using this measure. Also, RaTG13 is not an isolate, only an RNA sample collected in wild bat anal swabs. Conflating viral isolates with RNA samples seems to be a common error; an entry in a genetic database does not imply that a viable viral line exists in a lab. A RaTG13 lab isolate would have been an important achievement to further our scientific understanding.<p>I&#x27;m confused by the dismissals of the natural origins hypothesis. The horseshoe bat roosts, that are studied, are mostly found in or near Kunming, Yunnan. This lush wild area is part of the Lancang&#x2F;Mekong River watershed&#x2F;ecosystem shared by nocturnal bats and nocturnal arboreal mammals like palm civets, pangolins, and raccoon dogs. The nearby villages contain people engaged in guano collection, the wildlife trade, and domestic livestock farming.<p>The average incubation time of COVID-19 is 4.5 days. Armed with Google maps and a basic understanding of planes, trains, and automobiles we can gauge travel time from Kunming Airport to either Wuhan Tianhe International Airport (2 hr 5 min) or Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (2 hrs). In 2003, SARS-1 emerged in Guangzhou (near Hong Kong) and the now demonized Dr. Zheng-li Shi and her team traced the origins to palm civets (the intermediate host). Why is this so hard? Why do we not ridicule the assumption that travel between major Chinese transportation hubs must leave a wake of infections along the path?<p>Finally, Wade&#x27;s article mentions a U.S. State Department claim [2]:<p>&gt; The U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.<p>If true, this is an important early super-spreader event but the remainder of the release consists of a facile analysis performed by people more knowledgeable in geopolitics than science.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-021-00908-w"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-021-00908-w</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2017-2021.state.gov&#x2F;fact-sheet-activity-at-the-wuhan-institute-of-virology&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2017-2021.state.gov&#x2F;fact-sheet-activity-at-the-wuhan...</a>",finance,,general

She’s welcome to have whatever politics she wants—it’s America! But it’s wrong for the media to amplify her as if she is representative of Muslims in America as a whole.<p>This is a problem with progressives, which have disproportionate power in the media, and academia. As a group (for example Elizabeth Warren supporters) they’re as disproportionately white as the Republican Party. But they trade on the moral authority of purporting to speak for people of color. To that end, they amplify voices like Omar and Tlaib, whose politics are indistinguishable from those of secular white progressives, and not representative of Muslims. There are probably more Muslims who voted for Trump (about 1&#x2F;3) then ones who are as extreme in their politics as Omar and Tlaib. This pisses odd people like my parents, who are typical Muslim voters (moderate socially conservative Democrats).<p>It’s particularly problematic when, as the OP points out, whites people are judged differently for amplifying the voices of someone like Omar or Tlaib versus the voice of one of the many Muslims who voted for Trump. It suppresses conservatism within the community—progressive Muslims can count on getting tenure, getting in CNN, because white people are allowed to agree with and amplify them. But when conservative Muslims speak, white people are afraid to agree, and progressive whites often feel comfortable attacking them as tokens.

531,"On the nativeness, as I understand:<p>ZFS relies heavily on Solaris VFS API, which is inherently different from both Linux&#x27;s VFS and FreeBSD&#x27;s VFS implementation (e.g., vnode[1]). Both FreeBSD and Linux implements this VFS API with a layer called Solaris Porting Layer (SPL).<p>The original Illumos-upstream FreeBSD ZFS, this SPL layer was implemented as a kernel module (opensolaris.ko). OpenZFS originally maintain this shim in other repo, but later incorporate this shim into its codebase. FreeBSD port of OpenZFS involved importing SPL layer from FreeBSD tree into OpenZFS. On this part, there&#x27;s not much difference in nativeness of the port.<p>However, this SPL layer also serve the purpose of adding one degree of separation between GPL code and CDDL code in order to comply with GPL in order to prevent ZFS code from becoming a derivative of the Linux kernel. The shim in OpenZFS is in three licenses; the Linux part of SPL is GPLv2, the FreeBSD part is 2-BSD, and the part that interacts directly with ZFS code is CDDL.<p>This is the area where FreeBSD can be more native with regarding to ZFS. Since CDDL is compatible with BSD license, FreeBSD kernel and its userland can integrate directly with ZFS without any licensing issue, e.g., FreeBSD bootloader simply linked against ZFS, whereas GRUB2 must implement a part of ZFS in order to do probing.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD</a>",OS,,OS

100,"My biggest problem using Nix has been minor changes, like the address of upstream sources, rippling down through dependencies. Hopefully this will improve with content addressing, and make it easier to fetching from places like IPFS. As an example:<p>- I wrote a piece of software as part of a research project, which I kept in git and built using Nix.<p>- That tool was generally useful, so I didn&#x27;t want to pollute its repo with my particular experiment scripts&#x2F;results, etc. so I kept those in a separate repo which pinned a particular commit of that tool.<p>- The writeups&#x2F;papers based on these experiments had a lot of churn (as usual), so I kept those in a third git repo, which pinned a particular commit of the experimental results. These writeups did some analysis, generated graphs, etc. which was also managed by Nix.<p>This all worked great, everything was reproducible, identified by unforgable git commit IDs, etc. Then Microsoft bought GitHub and a bunch of people&#x2F;projects deleted their repos (e.g. moving to GitLab, or wherever). That broke the tool&#x27;s build, making the whole chain from tool -&gt; experiment -&gt; paper unreproducible. It was easy enough to fix by swapping the URLs in the .nix files, but that changed the git commit ID; hence the existing experimental data was tied to a commit which didn&#x27;t work.<p>Content-addressing would:<p>- Allow monkey-patching a fix, by letting me declare that both commits produce the same tool (despite their sources containing slightly different .nix files), and hence this change doesn&#x27;t alter the experimental results.<p>- Allow such issues to be prevented, by making it easier to fetch dependencies from content-addressed storage like IPFS, which reduces the reliance on third-party servers keeping URLs alive; e.g. I could keep hosting the desired sources myself.

I saw you mention &quot;twice as fast&quot; in another reply, something that compares apples to apples would be interesting.

683,"This is great work, but it almost makes me sad that you have to do this. I spent the earliest parts of my software career implementing full spectrum geospatial intelligence product generation algorithms for US intelligence agencies and the military. Part of the code base was software that does exactly this, but not with the historical, hand-drawn maps, but with the most current maps generated from aerial and space-borne radar sensing, as well as non-USGS data of, say, the ocean floor generated by US Navy sonar surveying programs. We could generate a map of any arbitrary coordinate boundaries of any part of the earth in seconds, using data that was at most a few years old.<p>There is absolutely no reason any of this code needs to be classified, as the maps themselves are not, the GeoTIFF format and tiling procedures are completely open standards, and the NGA has even open sourced some libraries for doing this kind of thing, but so much of the code that does this really quickly and efficiently, directly on your own workstation using C++ native executables into formats that can be rendered by a standard image viewer, is tied up in proprietary and even classified code bases just because of the monorepo nature of early work and the fact that development was done entirely on the classified systems because of the difficulty in developing on unclassified systems and then transferring across the air gap.<p>This is slowly changing, and in fact what I am presently working on is automated transfer and assurance mechanisms so more development that doesn&#x27;t need to be classified can be done on open systems and work shared, but it&#x27;s unfortunate to see so many wheels being reinvented when there are already really, really good tools to do these kinds of things but they are kept hidden.<p>We also have up-to-date indexed catalogs of exactly which tiles exist in which scale ranges to solve the problem you noted of trying to query and getting no data for poorly mapped regions. We can automatically retrieve the best data available and interpolate to the desired scale range instead. And rather than only getting the GeoTIFF, you can also get the raw altitude data intended for machine consumption, which is the main geoint use case for doing projections from sensor ephemeris to ground point.<p>I can see you also forked proj4js. This is of course also the kind of thing we had heavily optimized code for doing, since you have to project from lat&#x2F;lon to ECF in order to project from ground to coordinates in orbit, which are ECF (we had a need to do this before the open source libproj for C existed).<p>In any case, it&#x27;s unfortunate that you seemingly need to work for free doing this to get any attention and I hope you get a job out of it eventually. Sad to say I don&#x27;t think any of the big aerospace and intelligence players would give you a second look because of a basic requirement that everyone has a degree in engineering, physics, applied math, or computer science, but hopefully a more innovative, disruptive, and agile company will give you a look.

746,"I&#x27;m pretty sure that &quot;eval is a bad idea&quot; was mentioned in the &quot;thought terminating cliches&quot; topic on Ask HN a few days ago :)<p>In bash, `eval` is a footgun like any other. You can use it, but you just need to be aware of where your toes are when it shoots.<p>It&#x27;s usually a &quot;bad idea&quot; in the sense that if you think you need to use it, you probably don&#x27;t, and 90% of the time, there is an easier way to accomplish what you want to do. The next 5% of the time, using `eval` might be easier but will also create maintenance debt with its overgeneralization. And the final 5% of the time might be actual legit use cases for `eval`.<p>I just grepped my codebase for `eval` and I almost never use it. One example of the &quot;overgeneralized&quot; 5% might be when I realized I could use `eval` to set &quot;variable variables&quot; (i.e. the name of the variable is itself a variable, taken from a function argument). It was cool, but I ended up deleting it in favor of a more concrete solution.<p>Personally, if I&#x27;m hesitating to use `eval`, it&#x27;s usually not for any security reasons. In general, my bash scripts only exist in dev machines and CI runners, and I don&#x27;t copy them into the application containers that are exposed to a live runtime environment with untrusted users. So for CI&#x2F;dev scripts, I can safely assume the code will only run in CI&#x2F;dev, and therefore I can trust arbitrary user input (and I can still validate it as much as I want).",web/mobile,,

752,"&gt;I have yet to see any of this be an actual problem in real-world projects<p>Just on Monday, I was bitten by a bug caused by operator overloading. I&#x27;m building a static analysis tool in C++. There&#x27;s a method `getType()` that returns the qualified type of an expression. I had a call to `getType()` nested in some other calls, e.g. `expr-&gt;asAssignmentExpr()-&gt;getRHS()-&gt;getType()-&gt;getSomeQualifiedTypeProperty()`.<p>The creators of the `QualifiedType` type that&#x27;s returned by `getType()` had overridden the class member access operator to return an UnqualifiedType. This problem took me an embarrassingly long amount of time to diagnose. The compiler error messages told me that `UnqualifiedType` doesn&#x27;t have a property `getSomeQualifiedTypeProperty`, but I couldn&#x27;t see why I was getting an unqualified type from a method that is supposed to return a qualified type. I searched the documentation online, searched the header files, tried reinstalling the library, nothing made sense.<p>Then, I learned this operator had been overloaded.

Applications are more likely to be web-based or services - i.e. inherently distributed - and less likely to be desktop or traditional client&#x2F;server, where almost all compute happened on a single server. As distributed services, maximizing statelessness and avoiding mutable shared memory is key to solving a lot of problems: scaling out (no shared memory), redundancy (keep a second copy of the application logic running somewhere, no sync required), recovery and idempotence (if something fails, try again until it succeeds - repeated attempts are safe).<p>Reliable persistent queues are part of that. They let you bring services up and down and switch over without down time, or restart after a failure and resume where they left off.<p>The problems of shared mutable state are best kept in specialized applications: databases, queuing systems, distributed caches, consistent key-value stores.

951,"&gt;Conversely, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum have decentralized the process of issuing and managing a currency. But while the operations of such currencies, based on blockchains, have been fully decentralized, the trust graph of these cryptocurrencies have remained entirely centralized. Everyone need to trust Bitcoin to transact in Bitcoin, and everyone needs to trust Ethereum to transact in Ethereum or assets issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The centralized nature of the trust involved in these cryptocurrencies being actually at the core of how these currencies operate, as the only viable way to properly incentivize a proof-of-work system.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful to equivocate the trust one places in an open decentralized system with the trust someone puts in a custodian of their money to not run off with it. That&#x27;s like equivocating trusting end-to-end encryption to keep your messages secure with trusting Facebook to keep your messages secure. Sure, in both cases there&#x27;s a risk, but one is based on your understanding of an open system, and the other is based on a guess that the custodian you&#x27;re trusting your data to won&#x27;t choose to or accidentally expose it. Just because the word &quot;trust&quot; can be used for both doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t significant differences between them.<p>I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users doesn&#x27;t seem useful in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>The scalability of this system seems interesting, but I think the scalability upgrades that cryptocurrency is getting from sharding and rollups will keep cryptocurrency scalable enough for human commerce purposes. I wonder if details of this system would be more useful in some kind of scenario of machine swarms bartering with each other, maybe in a situation where a common currency specifically doesn&#x27;t make sense and is undesirable, or where there&#x27;s no reasonable-latency access to the common blockchain because of the isolation of the network.

1042,"&gt;Conversely, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum have decentralized the process of issuing and managing a currency. But while the operations of such currencies, based on blockchains, have been fully decentralized, the trust graph of these cryptocurrencies have remained entirely centralized. Everyone need to trust Bitcoin to transact in Bitcoin, and everyone needs to trust Ethereum to transact in Ethereum or assets issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The centralized nature of the trust involved in these cryptocurrencies being actually at the core of how these currencies operate, as the only viable way to properly incentivize a proof-of-work system.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful to equivocate the trust one places in an open decentralized system with the trust someone puts in a custodian of their money to not run off with it. That&#x27;s like equivocating trusting end-to-end encryption to keep your messages secure with trusting Facebook to keep your messages secure. Sure, in both cases there&#x27;s a risk, but one is based on your understanding of an open system, and the other is based on a guess that the custodian you&#x27;re trusting your data to won&#x27;t choose to or accidentally expose it. Just because the word &quot;trust&quot; can be used for both doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t significant differences between them.<p>I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users seems like a large obstacle in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>The scalability of this system seems interesting, but I think the scalability upgrades that cryptocurrency is getting from sharding and rollups will keep cryptocurrency scalable enough for human commerce purposes. I wonder if details of this system would be more useful in some kind of scenario of machine swarms bartering with each other, maybe in a situation where a common currency specifically doesn&#x27;t make sense and is undesirable, or where there&#x27;s no reasonable-latency access to the common blockchain because of the isolation of the network.

1314,"I think the idea of money as credit is very interesting (look at my HN comment history for my ramblings on the topic!).<p>&gt; I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users that could steal from you, needing to keep a node online always or trust your money to someone else who does so) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users seems like a large obstacle in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>You are right, these are disadvantages but other than &quot;trust paths&quot; the complexity can be mitigated with:<p>1. Market makers who buy IOUs at a discount and swap them for _their_ IOU which can be more trusted. Essentially you want a little bit of centralisation around parties which are known to always make good on their liabilities. These parties could be fully automated (think like Ethereum DAO) and transparent. In some ways these market makers are like banks of today but instead of lending their credit into existence, like banks do, they require people to buy it (usually) at a premium.<p>2. Insurance or a credit derivatives market so people can hedge against counterparts defaults.<p>3. If everyone agrees on a common numeraire and wallets are sophisticated to show an aggregate balance in that numeraire taking into account credit risk then that could remove much of the complexity for users. Integrated with market makers, you could &quot;auto swap&quot; IOUs to issuers which you prefer. Wallets can also provide a credit risk break down on all counterparts. Agree this is more complicated than current notions of money.<p>4. Securitisation markets. Package up IOUs into tranches. Traders can speculate on various levels of credit quality.<p>5. Sensible reputation management. Non-invasive performance tracking of debtors. Did they meet margin requirements? Did they meet all coupon payments? Etc. Can also take into account degree of co-operation with other users, for example do they accommodate restructuring and help others meet their liabilities?<p>I don&#x27;t like crypto because there&#x27;s essentially zero accountability for issuers and that kind of environment is optimal for scammers. Crypto behaves like synthetic equity&#x2F;commodity instruments with no accountable issuers. In contrast, with a credit based system, issuers are responsible for their issued liabilities and are expected to make good on them. In crypto, no-one thinks in terms of liabilities and so you get ridiculous projects like &quot;Synthentix&quot; who are collateralising a USD Stablecoins with their own issued tokens. For anyone with a basic understanding of financial risk and accounting, their approach is mad.<p>A credit based system is fairer because anyone can issue credit and the onus in on issuers to ensure they have the necessary reputation for others to accept their credit. Furthermore, credit-like instruments are natural Stablecoins - providing all agree on a numeraire, the value of credit is a function of credit risk which can be successfully managed in most cases.",finance,,

And yet, even in the midst of this crisis, COBOL systems didn’t actually break down. Although New Jersey’s governor issued his desperate plea for COBOL programmers, later investigations revealed that it was the website through which people filed claims, written in the comparatively much newer programming language Java, that was responsible for the errors, breakdowns, and slowdowns. The backend system that processed those claims—the one written in COBOL—hadn’t been to blame at all.<p>One can bet good money on the expectation that the mainframes will be the last component of a system to crash and burn.

C is very minimal and embedded developers are very reluctant to use <i>any</i> third party code so you end up with a lot of triangular and square shaped wheels so to speak. On the other hand C++ does offer a lot of nice (and appropriate to use) things that would normally be re-invented in a C codebase, however it offers almost too many things which precipitates weird, wrong, and hard to maintain abstractions.<p>At least in my domain I feel the problem is developers just throwing code at a problem until it compiles and exhibits the expected behavior in the happy path before moving on to the next feature. This leads to the same concept being re-invented multiple times in the same code base in new and exciting ways. After all the goal is not to develop nice abstractions, it&#x27;s to make a product that can be sold.<p>I would say C++ is an amazing language for library authors who are necessarily talented and spend the time to create robust, easy to use, and well thought out abstractions that can make the life of an application developer vastly easier.<p>Of course your mileage my vary as I&#x27;m sure the wider software world doesn&#x27;t have all of the same problems that embedded has.

That would have been a monumentally stupid move if they weren&#x27;t intending to live up to it.<p>&gt; they put Apple first above everything else<p>A weird accusation. Setting aside immutable truths about the motivations of any corporation, Apple has <i>famously</i> placed their customers ahead of many other external concerns. Case in point—where they have actively defied the wishes of the FBI (and similar arms of many world governments) in the implementation of robust on-device encryption and cryptographic security.<p>&gt; I only see them getting an exclusive view of user behavior on their devices.<p>That&#x27;s an absurd complaint. Who are these other people that you think should have access to my data? <i>Damn right</i> it should be exclusive to Apple—people are paying them good money to be a trustworthy steward of their data.",web/mobile,,

Most transactional memory proposals are not page level granularity - though obviously most proposals have certain limits, and byte level being too granular doesn&#x27;t even make any sense.",general,,

The SS was _not_ the German army. The SS was the military organization of the Nazi party - often conflicting with the army to achieve their goals. They enforced racial policy in Germany and its conquests, ran the concentration camps and death camps, and were specifically tasked with eliminating Jews.<p>Perhaps it is because of the collective guilt of not having done enough for Jews at the time, but people often gloss over the explicitly racial and antisemitic aspect of World War II.

I mean projects and not developers because projects tend to hire like developers and then developers mostly share same problematic quality.  In the end it is not individual contributors who are at fault but management who allowed it to happen.<p>#1. Insufficient programming skills. This where developers don&#x27;t use libraries because they don&#x27;t even know they exist, can&#x27;t recognize the problem they are solving as generic. This is where they can&#x27;t structure the code because they haven&#x27;t seen much code at all and&#x2F;or are not interested in learning.<p>You can recognize this immediately as codebases with a lot of code duplication and very weak structure&#x2F;abstractions.<p>#2. Too much programming ambition. This is where developers think so highly of themselves that they can&#x27;t accept existing off the shelf components and will reinvent them because they can do better. They will write new everything because it will offer 10% performance increase in their specific case or just for the intelectual fun of doing it. They will obsess over ensuring there is no duplication of code at the cost of creating baroque structures that have no meaning and purpose other than ensure that every single component works in every single case supported by the application and in any possible future.<p>You can recognize this as codebases with no duplication but when you try to read the code it seems the structure is so complicated you need to have a huge map on entire wall and a guide to be able to travel the codebase. Most of the objects don&#x27;t have any meaning in the domain of the problem and are just abstract &quot;stuff&quot; necessary to glue everything together.<p>I very much prefer working with case #1<p>The reason is that, as dumb as the code is, you can read it and understand what the author <i>probably</i> had in mind, what the application attempts to do. You can then work with the code, refactor functionality out, and so on.<p>In my experience case #2 is usually beyond repair (or at least beyond my abilities to repair). These developers become easily hostile -- because they think very highly of themselves they treat everybody as inferior and now I am trying to write some dumb unsophisticated code and so I must be dumb. They also tend to change jobs pretty easily so the only result of trying to fix that kind of project is people suddenly leaving it and management getting restless at the lack of progress.<p>And for some reason every single C++ team I worked with falls under case #2.<p>I think because, given so many options, you need to have ambition to willingly choose C++ as your main programming language and so the population is preselected.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are all highly intelligent people.

1981,"Sure, it&#x27;s more an observation of the mechanics underpinning cryptocurrencies. My statement was actually incorrect in that there are not actually &quot;issuers&quot; per se in crypto and that can be a problem.<p>Cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH and whatever else are not &quot;money&quot; in the sense that we generally understand. This money is either a credit on a commercial bank or a credit on a central bank. These entities are responsible for managing the liquidity and solvency of their balance sheet such that the credit you hold retains value (Yes, I know there is inflation but that&#x27;s an orthogonal concern, I would argue). There is a governance and legal framework underpinning how money works in this &quot;mundane World&quot;. Everything in the mundane world is a legal agreement. Financial agreements are always someone&#x27;s liability and that&#x27;s a good thing because someone is always accountable if something goes wrong.<p>Cryptocurrency behaves more like some kind of synthetic commodity. By that I mean that it inherently has no value and has no use for anything other than being a &quot;token&quot;. When cryptocurrency is created, it has no issuer. There&#x27;s no accepted legal framework or explicit governance framework for holding people accountable if something goes wrong (other than code is law) and things go wrong all the time. There are rug pulls, exchange rate crashes and project failures are ten a penny etc... and this is all happening while the crypto world is in a mega bull market! What happens when the next bear market comes around? All the projects that _seem_ viable now will suddenly become unviable. All the debt positions collateralised with sketchy crypto will unwind en masse. I suspect the tokens for many projects out there will trade close to zero. People who invested in various projects from algo stablecoins to lending protocols will suddenly find that they hold worthless tokens with zero recourse. By this point the insiders would have exited into BTC&#x2F;ETH&#x2F;fiat ready to start the next round of &quot;projects&quot;.<p>Maybe this is OK. I mean, it is what it is and clearly some people are fine with that. I think we can do better though. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m interested in credit based monetary systems because reputation is a key part, so participants are accountable for their actions. This is fundamental for any significant real world adoption. Furthermore, credit based instruments do have intrinsic value which is a function of issuer credit risk. Such instruments are more stable than &quot;synthetic commodities&quot; and have more utility for real world uses.<p>Having said all that. I work in the crypto world and quite enjoy it. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as some would have you believe.",finance,,

2014,"Below the surface level question of &quot;did it escape a lab&quot; is the question of why that matters to people. Both escaping a lab and evolving naturally in the wild are in essence freak accidents. A roll of the cosmic dice. A bristling array of implausibilities. What difference does it make that we got unlucky in this way as opposed to that way?<p>Would the logical conclusion from the &quot;escaped a lab&quot; theory be that China shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have virology research? Should any nation? Who gets to decide? Exactly what actionable conclusion depends on knowing if the origin of the virus was a lab or not?<p>There are maybe one in a dozen proponents of the lab theory that are legitimately interested in these questions. For the remaining 11 out of 12, the Wuhan Lab theory is just a belief that they wear in public to signal &quot;China bad&quot;. An alarming number of people think China created the virus and released it on purpose. I once heard someone say China released the virus just to prove that our healthcare system is bad. Let me highlight the absurdity here. This person believes China engineered a virus and then released it on their own people in a city most foreigners were unaware of so that it would eventually make it to the US. They did all this just to prove some politically left point about socialized healthcare. That&#x27;s not a real belief about how the world works. That&#x27;s thinly veiled &quot;I hate liberals and China&quot;.<p>Most of these people are trying to reach a conclusion that the world should punish China with sanctions or (in extreme cases) war.

For example, the typical &quot;protected&quot; intersection with curb extensions and an offset assumes that a motorist will look down the bike path to check for cyclists before exiting an intersection while moving at 10 mph.  In reality, drivers aren&#x27;t going to do that.<p>As I noted earlier, this principle works with pedestrians, because, while walking, they&#x27;re moving around 5 feet per second, so seeing a pedestrian 10 feet away from the intersection is pretty easy for a driver making a turn since they really don&#x27;t have to look down the sidewalk.<p>In contrast, a cyclist is moving anywhere from 15 to 30 feet per second.  A cyclist that&#x27;s two seconds away from entering an intersection can be anywhere from 30 to 60 feet away.  This requires a drivers to actually look down the bike path, which isn&#x27;t always going to occur.  The cyclist may assume that the turning driver has seen them, but that assumption is in correct, and the cyclist will have to slow rapidly to avoid a collision.<p>Also, a lot of cyclists, when making use of such infrastructure, believe that they have pedestrian style right of way, meaning that they will do things like ride around the front of a turning vehicle believing that they&#x27;ll stop to avoid a collision instead of just yielding.<p>A typical person takes about a second or so to react to something unexpected.  At 10 mph, the motorist has already covered 16 feet, meaning that they would collide with a cyclist before they have a chance to even press the brake pedal.",general,,

They can rely on western scientists to debunk the lab created hypothesis.  That leaves their own theories about it originated in Italy as the standing theory for their own domestic consumption.  And that avoids looking at their animal farming practices and keeps them from having to crack down on that whole economy, which would be highly disruptive.<p>And this keeps factory farming conveniently entirely off the radar as a cause of this pandemic.  The next pandemic could easily be a virus that hops to humans from pigs or chickens in the USA.  All the yelling both ways about lab origins is a very effective smokescreen to avoid doing anything to prevent a future pandemic.  NOTHING will happen to prevent future pandemics over yelling about lab causes other than making some people in America very, very angry about China.

After 4 hours, I was sent home with a note to take two extra strength Tylenol.  And for the 20 years that followed, that was about the quality of treatment I received.<p>Everything, for me, is solved with a medication that is very rarely prescribed for Migraine.  My issue is that I cannot take the usual medications (imitrex, etc).  They are effective, but I lack a gene that is required to flush them from my system correctly and had this effect where 30 minutes after taking the pill I&#x27;d be the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been in my entire life, and about 1.5 hours later, I&#x27;d be miserable ... <i>comical-if-they-weren&#x27;t-happening-to-you</i> mood swings, which almost killed me[2].<p>The thing of it is, I&#x27;ve seen several doctors for this.  After a mess of semi-unrelated circumstances around that event which almost killed me, I ended up on a prescription for Depokote.

I&#x27;ll admit, after reading this, I&#x27;m wondering if I really have Migraine or if I don&#x27;t have some other thing (cluster was ruled out).  My triggers are seasonal; and I have bad days when there has been a large shift from high-&gt;low or low-&gt; high.  Interestingly, though, if I get a migraine, I am pretty much insulated from getting another one for about a week, which implies some sort of biological process that is serving some function, since multiple repeats of that trigger, or even much stronger ones, will not cause a second migraine for several days after one already landed.<p>[0] Varying lengths but until I learned to cope with the symptoms, it at least destroyed the entire rest of the remaining day once it hit.  Often remained a day after, as well.<p>[1] I really, <i>really</i>, hated hospitals as a kid.

It. Was. Bad.<p>[3] I never thought of myself as anxious, and it&#x27;s never been an issue in my life -- that I know of -- that has held me back.

2710,"I started getting Migraine headaches in the late spring at age 17 and continued to get them in the spring&#x2F;fall weekly for about two decades[0].  I remember the age and the season because, up to that point, I had headaches.  What happened that day resulted in a trip to the emergency room, on my insistence; I thought my brain was bleeding[1].  After 4 hours, I was sent home with a note to take two extra strength Tylenol.  And for the 20 years that followed, that was about the quality of treatment I received.<p>Everything, for me, is solved with a medication that is very rarely prescribed for Migraine.  My issue is that I cannot take the usual medications (imitrex, etc).  They are effective, but I lack a gene that is required to flush them from my system correctly.  So 30 minutes after taking the pill I&#x27;d be the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been in my entire life, and about 1.5 hours later, I&#x27;d be miserable.  It was <i>comical-if-they-weren&#x27;t-happening-to-you</i> mood swings, which almost killed me[2].<p>I&#x27;ve seen several doctors for this.  After a mess of semi-unrelated circumstances around that event which almost killed me, I ended up on a prescription for Depokote.  It&#x27;s a very old medication, originally prescribed for seizures and I now commonly used off-label for bipolar.  It was prescribed to me with the endorsement of &quot;a few of my patients responded well to this, none of them had side effects, and this is where we&#x27;re at on the list of choices&quot; ... basically, the guy had no confidence it would work, so I didn&#x27;t either.  It was prescribed mid-summer, and I noticed after about a week that I felt like I was carrying around <i>zero</i> anxiety[3], and a number of other fantastic side-effects[4].  By the end of the following spring, I was convinced it worked -- completely.  It was the first year I had gone any season without a single Migraine headache.  Interestingly, I&#x27;d get the &quot;aura&quot;, on occasion, but it would never melt into horrifying pain.<p>The whole time, regardless of specialist, there wasn&#x27;t anyone who could give me a really good idea of just what the hell was really going on in my skull.  I&#x27;ll admit, after reading this, I&#x27;m wondering if I really have Migraine or if I don&#x27;t have some other thing (cluster was ruled out).  My triggers are seasonal; and I have bad days when there has been a large shift from high-&gt;low or low-&gt; high.  Interestingly, though, if I get a migraine, I am pretty much insulated from getting another one for about a week, which implies some sort of biological process that is serving some function, since multiple repeats of that trigger, or even much stronger ones, will not cause a second migraine for several days after one already landed.<p>[0] Varying lengths but until I learned to cope with the symptoms, it at least destroyed the entire rest of the remaining day once it hit.  Often remained a day after, as well.<p>[1] I really, <i>really</i>, hated hospitals as a kid.  My parents took me on my insistence because they knew I would only demand to go if I seriously thought I was dying ... even though it was a headache.<p>[2] A combination of medications related to Migraine which I took during an attack (as prescribed) resulted in my serotonin levels sending me to the hospital. It. Was. Bad.<p>[3] I never thought of myself as anxious, and it&#x27;s never been an issue in my life -- that I know of -- that has held me back.  But, holy cow, the difference was <i>stark</i>.<p>[4] For medications with &quot;brain affecting&quot; side-effects, I <i>do not</i> read the label.  My wife takes that responsibility.  My thinking is: (1) placebo&#x2F;nocebo effect is really strong when the thing it effects is emotional&#x2F;personality.

The WIV did lots of work sampling viruses from nature, in remote bat caves that very few other humans would ever enter--around Yunnan to be clear, about 900 miles from Wuhan--and they could have leaked a novel virus before they even had a chance to sequence it.

2845,"Unfortunately, I do not remember right now some good titles, but there are various books about comparative linguistics, which analyze the similarities and differences between languages and the various existing ways of expressing the same content.<p>Most ancient languages, including most ancient Indo-European languages, like Latin or Ancient Greek, allowed a free order of the words, because there were markers for each syntactic role, like agent, patient, instrument, beneficiary and so on (i.e. the so-called cases).<p>Nevertheless, at the stage where the old Indo-European languages became attested in writing, they had a very serious defect. Even if the so-called case terminations of the words were originally a small set of post-positions corresponding to the syntactic roles, due to various phonetic evolutions conditioned by the adjacent sounds present in words, the original small set of markers had diverged into a very large set of word terminations with many distinct variants for each syntactic role, the so-called word declensions.<p>Because remembering such a large set of word terminations became too difficult, most modern European languages have abandoned the old declensions. Some languages use enough prepositions, possibly together with some remnants of the old case terminations, to allow a free order of the words.<p>English however, depends a lot on the standard order of the words to convey their syntactic roles and it has only limited means of expression for supporting a different word order.<p>While in the Indo-European languages the too irregular word declensions could not persist, there are other language families with a much more regular structure for the syntactic role markers, while still having enough markers to allow a free word order.<p>It is weird that the European linguists of the previous centuries considered the regular languages (the so-called agglutinative languages or isolant languages) as &quot;primitive&quot; while considering the &quot;flexionar&quot; classic Indo-European languages as &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot;.<p>In fact even if the flexionar classic Indo-European languages evolved from some older agglutinative language, their irregular declensions were a serious defect and not a sign of progress.<p>Unfortunately, because the language changes have always been done mostly by the less educated people, without having any kind of grand plan of how to best improve the language, the necessary simplifications of the language have also been frequently accompanied by a loss of expressiveness, like in English.",web/mobile,,

They&#x27;ll hide really huge twists and revelations as easily missed off-handed comments.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that the story feels really weak until you discover all those little details and piece all the twists together.  And that doesn&#x27;t happen until the last act or so.  I spent the vast majority of the game thinking X, Y, and Z scenes were really dumb until their context was finally revealed.<p>I can appreciate that type of storytelling.  It&#x27;s different and more complex than I guess most &quot;Western&quot; writing.  But it&#x27;s hard to escape the taint it puts on most of my time with the game.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m not writing this to convince you personally to rethink your experience with the game.  Like I said, if the story doesn&#x27;t work for someone, Automata is an awful game.

Those hacks were the state of the art for all Windows screen readers from the late 90s through the mid to late 2000s; I did similar hacks myself.

These days, web browsers implement documented accessibility APIs (there are still a couple of competing APIs on Windows), and screen readers consume them. Of course, between the web application, the browser, and the screen reader, there&#x27;s still room for misinterpretation of the standards, but the situation is better than it was back then.<p>As for Linux, I dislike the Orca screen reader simply as a user.

Whether the companies that became dominant were founded by younger or older people is irrelevant to the argument.<p>The main point I took away from this article is that the younger people today, Millenials if you will, are not used to an open internet, so they see the internet as a closed gate community, a divisive force. A completely different view of the Internet than the previous generation had. And as the younger people are the ones with the most energy to fight against what they perceive as injustices, they tend to actually dominate policy making even if indirectly, and what they see as the enemy is things like encryption and even privacy, which the previous generation saw as essential for a free Internet.<p>I agree completely with that, but I am not optimistic as the author is that GenXers will at some point get their act together and make the internet more open again. I believe what will happen is that the Internet will continue being this divisive force until legislation (pushed by younger people who don&#x27;t know better) is introduced to curtail freedom of expression and remove all privacy in the name of justice.

I was also interested in math, and I ended up taking three courses from him: an introduction to mathematical logic, with about twenty students; a seminar on set theory and the foundations of arithmetic, with four or five students; and a one-on-one tutorial on point-set topology.<p>For the latter two courses, he taught based on his “do mathematics” principle. He would provide us with definitions of basic concepts and then have us work through a series of not-so-difficult problems that led eventually to proofs of the major theorems. He let us do most of the work ourselves, though if we got stuck he would provide pointers to help us keep moving ahead. His method was inspired by that of Robert Lee Moore [1], though Halmos was not as hard-assed about it as Moore reportedly was [2]. In the seminar, he encouraged the students to work together.<p>More than forty years later, I remember many details of the two problem-based courses, while the first course, in which he lectured on mathematical logic, has mostly slipped from my memory.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Moore_method"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Moore_method</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk&#x2F;Extras&#x2F;Halmos_Moore_method&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk&#x2F;Extras&#x2F;Halmos_Moore_me...</a>",OS,,

Celestial objects were described as moving in circles, because perfect circular motion was considered an innate property of objects that existed in the uncorrupted realm of the celestial spheres. The theory of impetus, the ancestor to the concepts of inertia and momentum, was developed along similar lines by medieval philosophers such as John Philoponus and Jean Buridan. Motions below the lunar sphere were seen as imperfect, and thus could not be expected to exhibit consistent motion. More idealized motion in the &quot;sublunary&quot; realm could only be achieved through artifice, and prior to the 17th century, many did not view artificial experiments as a valid means of learning about the natural world. Physical explanations in the sublunary realm revolved around tendencies. Stones contained the element earth, and earthly objects tended to move in a straight line toward the centre of the earth (and the universe in the Aristotelian geocentric view) unless otherwise prevented from doing so.[25]<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_physics#Medieval_Europe"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_physics#Medieval_Eu...</a><p>That was what the best of humanity could come up with over 2 millennia.

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;

3540,"It&#x27;s got a lot of feng shui for simple computer architectures.<p>For one thing, you can have your code, static memory, and then heap at the beginning of the address space, and the stack at the end of the address space, and not have to worry about explicitly sizing the stack. On some architectures you could even just zero-initialize the stack pointer, and it will roll over to the end of memory on the first push.<p>You can also use the same machine code instructions that make array indexing efficient to access variables on the stack (load&#x2F;store with literal offset,) without having to support signed offsets which would have effectively wasted a precious bit in a very common opcode.<p>When you overrun a buffer, it is more likely to cause your program to crash by corrupting the stack. This is bad in modern times for obvious security reasons, but pragmatically it would have been a useful &quot;feature&quot; in the early days of programming.<p>It pairs nicely with the semantics of a semaphore, where you decrement to acquire and increment to release.<p>The stack pointer conceptually points to valid memory, rather than pointing to invalid memory adjacent to valid memory. This likely has some favorable traits when it comes to how an architecture implements function calls. For example, RET could load the value at the stack pointer into the program counter, then increment the stack pointer. Loading from memory often takes multiple cycles compared to incrementing a register, and this starts the load a cycle earlier than otherwise for the same amount of combinatorial logic.",web/mobile,,

And in a lot of places, user experience is outright horrible because of the restrictions. Have you ever tried to move music from files to the music app? You can&#x27;t. So I have music on my iPhone I basically cannot play. Same for videos. And a lot of data handling is awkward at least. With all their power through the App Store, Apple should insist that all apps which have some sort of local data also support the files app. That all apps which play video properly support picture in picture (most don&#x27;t or differently).

3607,"&gt; This is largely a myth, please provide an namespace-related CVE that has gone unpatched to support your argument.<p>What I mean is that if you use LXC namespace&#x27;s as a container it is going to be an insecure container. Simply because LXC namespace&#x27;s are not containers and are not going to provide a fully isolated environment. Namespace&#x27;s are low-level building blocks which, together with other technologies (for example a virtualized network stack), you can use to make fully isolated containers. And that&#x27;s why most hosters just took a shortcut and put the whole thing in a hardware VM to ensure tenants are fully isolated. Which I think is a shame since you also get all the overhead of a hardware VM.<p>So sure, you can _make_ something like jails or zones on Linux if you combine a bunch of things and provide the glue. But there is no concept of a container like jails or zones in Linux. Which leads to other problems such as there not being any tooling to mange the (non-existant) container.<p>&gt;  The reason they run as VMs is that hypervisors run on ring 0 and require higher privileges than the kernel, therefore they are naturally more secure.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I fully understand what your saying here but I think you mean that with a type 2 hypervisor the hypervisors kernel runs in a more privileged mode on the CPU then the virtualized kernels it manages and that provides additional security?<p>I don&#x27;t really see how a type 2 hypervisor would conceptually give additional security in regards to a type 1 hypervisor (where a single kernel can provide multiple OS instances such a FreeBSD with Jails or Solaris &#x2F; Illumos with Zones). Everything that is not the &quot;main&quot; kernel always executes in a less privileged mode then the kernel executing them on the CPU. For example no user process executes on Ring 0 on a &quot;normal&quot; (ie. non-hypervisor) OS. With containers this is no different. Hardware virtualization doesn&#x27;t give a big conceptual advantage in that regard as far as I know.",OS,,

The things took so much effort and were an inferior version to the real thing, not to mention the amount of oils necessary to keep them intact.<p>The closest thing we had was this creole veg serve with polenta, that had tons of oil and butter in the polenta and the creole veg had been marinated in quite a bit of oil along with the spices to keep them moist throughout service.<p>I&#x27;m an omnivore with a massive conservationist mindset, and did Biodynamic Ag. So I just intermittent fast for 16 hours a day and only eat once a day now that I don&#x27;t farm any more. But I grew up on cantonese food where protein was used sparingly, and unlike most kids in the West we gladly ate tofu and vegetables all year round in our homemade meals.<p>Eating unadulterated seasonal veg is way tastier than eating a mushroom burger with absurd amounts of oils and saturated fats and breading, smeared with vegan mayo etc... I never ate anything but the soups at work, as the rest of the menu all had so much more stuff added to it that caused a very noticeable feeling of inflammation--which is typical for vegetarians and vegans.<p>I&#x27;ve ate those impossible burgers when BK launched them and did side by side with a normal whopper when they were on the 2&#x2F;$5 promo for a while, and the way I ate them (I sauted onions with korean BBQ sauce and garnished with kimchi and maybe an egg if I really had time) you couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.<p>But, as a cook I was always perplexed: why put so much inputs into something (burger) that wasn&#x27;t meant to be eaten more than once a week?<p>The real issue to the obesity issue in much of the West is a lack of exercise coupled with over consumption of calories, from all sources be it veg or animal protein, instead of having a burger as a treat once a week: many people, mainly the poor, subsist on this stuff due to the race to the bottom price wars typical in fast food paired with a sedentary lifestyle. But the price factor is not as day and night as it&#x27;s made out to be if you actually have an education on diets suited for your lifestyle, something entirely missing in the US.<p>I think post-covid people need to take a very serious look at who was really affected by COVID in the West--I&#x27;m aware that India is getting hit hard and they have a mainly plant based diet, but this seems mainly due to an inability to convince it&#x27;s population to follow lock-down, quarantine, or mask wearing measures and an ability to vaccinate due to an ongoing lack of trust in their government.<p>Most of the deaths in the West were from the elderly population, and the medically ill with a remarkable concentration on people with diabetes, obesity, asthma as the co-morbidity factors.",general,,

Follow these simple rules when defining macros: 1) parenthesize usages of macro params, and parenthesize the whole macro body if it is a complete expression. 2) Use parameters that take syntactical expressions only once, to prevent evaluating side-effects (like x++) multiple times.<p>Linux kernel even allows for variable declaration in macros by using expression statement blocks (GCC extension). Although I&#x27;ve never had a need for them, I believe that with this approach you can fulfill rule 2) in all possible situations.<p>You can improve macro safety in cases where you need to define a macro that is a little dangerous by just capitalizing the macro&#x27;s name to make clear at the call site to be a little bit careful here.

Because there are always so many other ways to break your programming, and if you&#x27;re trying to be 100% safe at the cost of being twice as hard to use, that&#x27;s effectively a net loss because you&#x27;re provoking problems in other ways.<p>&gt; On the other hand, with RIAA, you just have your file_handle that automatically close so you can&#x27;t forgot to close it, and the rules are well known and not that difficult to understand.<p>Could agree if it&#x27;s a file handle or something other off-the-shelf thing where you don&#x27;t have to make the class yourself, and everybody instinctively is aware of the implicit behaviour.

Cows might emit methane and co2, but that carbon came from their food, and that carbon in their food was captured from the air, so it&#x27;s actually a cycle without net increase in carbon in the air. That&#x27;s unlike fossil fuels, which bring carbon from the ground into the air and actually increase the carbon in the air in the process. The only real net emissions in the process of creating beef are the fossil fuels burned in the process, from transportation.<p>This distinction between real carbon emission, and carbon cycle is important because there&#x27;s misguided notion of how much of a real difference it would make if people stopped eating meat. The decrease in emissions will be offset by a decrease in carbon capture from their food, and the net difference will be much less than assumed.<p>Moreover, if the process of creating meat replacements requires more fossil fuels to be burned than the natural process of growing food and feeding cattle, it might be that alternative meats are detrimental to the environment.

They have the highest error rate of replication of any known organism. Which means, after some discrete amount of generations, you could wind up with some sort of &quot;mosaic&quot; + &quot;chimeric&quot; virus. Again though, how many generations is under hot dispute.

But as a technology it&#x27;s not spread widely in the industry, despite the fundamental advantage of composability. I personally would attribute this to a sort of gulf created by two common approaches:<p>1. It&#x27;s become very common to structure software as a stateless service cluster backed by a stateful database technology. Most of the databases used in this approach would not be described as STM, but the net effect to the application is similar, even if involving more layers and complexity.<p>2. People have gotten pretty comfortable with simple mutex patterns connected by queues of various sorts. This is a sort of worse is better situation, where the simplicity and high performance of a mutex protected whatever in a toy test or microbenchmark is far more efficient than STM. However, a system composed of many of these mutex protected islands proves a whole different beast indeed. STM has largely been criticized from the perspective of the former, vs the latter.<p>There are many people who have made the observation that transactional concurrency control, state of the art garbage collection, and even file systems have been converging on similar features. This is being driven by the common constrains on both sides of what hardware and humans expect.

This would clear out the underbrush so that there was never too much at any given time.<p>But over the last century or so, well intentioned environmentalism has meant that these fires get put out before they get going. This has led to a very dense accumulation of this underbrush and young growth trees, which essentially have turned California forests into tinderboxes.

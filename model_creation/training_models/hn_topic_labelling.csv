This is different from how the majority of cancer patients are treated today: surgery and {chemo,radio}therapy.<p>Here is a problem in our domain where tech is one of the limiting factors.<p>If you look at the DNA of any cell and compare it against the reference genome, you&#x27;ll find a lot of differences, aka variants. Typically even more so if you&#x27;re looking at a sequenced tumour (~1e6 variants). This is your hay stack. And a variant that can be medically targeted to treat the cancer is the needle. The definition of what variant is &quot;clinically relevant&quot; is layered, context-dependent, and (partially) regulated. Software is responsible for automating away the majority of variants, say down to 10-100, in a justifiable, traceable way. It&#x27;s also responsible for giving tools to the clinician to deal with the remaining ones. This manual step typically involves an informed line of questioning about each variant backed by 100s of supporting data points about it.<p>Without these two tech pieces, interpreting a single molecular pathology report can and does take many hours of (expensive) expert time, instead of minutes. For a rough sense of scale: human genome has ~3e9 nucleotides (ACTG), has ~3e4 known genes, ~1e6 known gene interactions, and ~1e8 known variants.

1325,"Where they get you is that it very rarely makes financial sense to do both cloud and colo&#x2F;on-prem (unless you&#x27;re a massive company).  It ends up being way more expensive to use the cloud, but also hire engineers to work on making an on-prem cloud.  Most companies have a mixed bag of projects that are either better served by the cloud, or are okay with colo and the savings it can bring.<p>Assuming you don&#x27;t want to do a hybrid approach, then you either push everyone onto the cloud and accept paying more, or you push everyone into colo and force the small and scaling out projects to deal with stuff like having to order hardware 3 months in advance.<p>Then, depending on how nice you want it to be to interact with your infrastructure, you can end up paying a lot to have people build abstractions over it.  Do you want developers to be able to create their own database from a merge request or API call?  If so, now you&#x27;re going to have to hire someone with a 6 figure salary to figure out how to do that.  It&#x27;s easy to forget how many things are involved in that.  You&#x27;re going to have a lot of databases, so you need a system to track them.  A lot of these databases are presumably not big enough to warrant a full physical server, so you have to sort out multi-tenancy.  If you have multi-tenancy, you need a way to handle RBAC so one user can&#x27;t bork all the databases on the host.  You will also need some way to handle what happens when one user is throwing so much load at the RDBMS it&#x27;s impacting other apps on that database.  To accomplish that, you&#x27;re going to need a way to gather metrics that are sharded per-database and a way to monitor those (which is admittedly one of the easier bits).  You also generally just straight up lose a lot of the scaling features.  I don&#x27;t have a way to just give you more IOPS to your database on-prem.  The best I can do is add more disks, but your database will be down for a long time if I have to put a disk in, expand the RAID, let it redistribute data and then power it back up.  That&#x27;s several hours of downtime for you, along with anyone who&#x27;s on the same database.  Of course, we can do replicas, and swap the master, but everyone will have to reconfigure their apps or we need something like Consul to handle that (which means more engineers to manage that stuff).<p>You&#x27;re also probably going to need more than one of those expensive infra people, because they presumably need an on-call rotation, and no one is going to agree to be on-call the time.  And every time someone quits, you have to train the new person, which is several months of salary basically wasted.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that you don&#x27;t need infra people on AWS, but you a) need a lot less of them, because they only need to manage the systems AWS has, not build them, and b) you can hire cheaper ops people, again because you don&#x27;t need people that are capable of building those kinds of systems.<p>Once you factor in all of that stuff, AWS&#x27; prices start looking more reasonable.  They&#x27;re still a little higher, but they&#x27;re not double the price.  If anything more than a tiny, tiny subset of the AWS features are appealing, it&#x27;s going to cost you almost as much to build your own as it does to just pay Amazon&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;whoever.<p>Also, a massive thing people overlook is that AWS is fairly well documented.  I can Google exactly how to set up permissions on an S3 bucket, or how to use an S3 bucket as a website.  It only takes seconds, the cognitive burden is low, and the low-friction doesn&#x27;t cause anyone stress.  In-house systems tend to be poorly documented, and doing anything slightly outside the norm becomes a &quot;set up a meeting with the infra team&quot; kind of thing.

OpenZFS originally maintain this shim in other repo, but later incorporate this shim into its codebase. FreeBSD port of OpenZFS involved importing SPL layer from FreeBSD tree into OpenZFS. On this part, there&#x27;s not much difference in nativeness of the port.<p>However, this SPL layer also serve the purpose of adding one degree of separation between GPL code and CDDL code in order to comply with GPL in order to prevent ZFS code from becoming a derivative of the Linux kernel. The shim in OpenZFS is in three licenses; the Linux part of SPL is GPLv2, the FreeBSD part is 2-BSD, and the part that interacts directly with ZFS code is CDDL.<p>This is the area where FreeBSD can be more native with regarding to ZFS. Since CDDL is compatible with BSD license, FreeBSD kernel and its userland can integrate directly with ZFS without any licensing issue, e.g., FreeBSD bootloader simply linked against ZFS, whereas GRUB2 must implement a part of ZFS in order to do probing.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD</a>",OS,,devops/OS

What it actually looks for is \EFI\BOOT\BOOT{machine type short-name}.EFI - &#x27;x64&#x27; is the &quot;machine type short-name&quot; for x86-64 PCs.

1042,"&gt;Conversely, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum have decentralized the process of issuing and managing a currency. But while the operations of such currencies, based on blockchains, have been fully decentralized, the trust graph of these cryptocurrencies have remained entirely centralized. Everyone need to trust Bitcoin to transact in Bitcoin, and everyone needs to trust Ethereum to transact in Ethereum or assets issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The centralized nature of the trust involved in these cryptocurrencies being actually at the core of how these currencies operate, as the only viable way to properly incentivize a proof-of-work system.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful to equivocate the trust one places in an open decentralized system with the trust someone puts in a custodian of their money to not run off with it. That&#x27;s like equivocating trusting end-to-end encryption to keep your messages secure with trusting Facebook to keep your messages secure. Sure, in both cases there&#x27;s a risk, but one is based on your understanding of an open system, and the other is based on a guess that the custodian you&#x27;re trusting your data to won&#x27;t choose to or accidentally expose it. Just because the word &quot;trust&quot; can be used for both doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t significant differences between them.<p>I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users seems like a large obstacle in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>The scalability of this system seems interesting, but I think the scalability upgrades that cryptocurrency is getting from sharding and rollups will keep cryptocurrency scalable enough for human commerce purposes.

1310,"I think the idea of money as credit is very interesting (look at my HN comment history for my ramblings on the topic!).<p>&gt; I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users that could steal from you, needing to keep a node online always or trust your money to someone else who does so) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users seems like a large obstacle in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>You are right, these are disadvantages but other than &quot;trust paths&quot; the complexity can be mitigated with:<p>1. Market makers who buy IOUs at a discount and swap them for _their_ IOU which can be more trusted. Essentially you want a little bit of centralisation around parties which are known to always make good on their liabilities. These parties could be fully automated (think like Ethereum DAO) and transparent. In some ways these market makers are like banks of today but instead of lending their credit into existence, like banks do, they require people to buy it (usually) at a premium.
2. Insurance or a credit derivatives market so people can hedge against counterparts defaults.
3. If everyone agrees on a common numeraire and wallets are sophisticated to show an aggregate balance in that numeraire taking into account credit risk then that could remove much of the complexity for users. Integrated with market makers, you could &quot;auto swap&quot; IOUs to issuers which you prefer. Wallets can also provide a credit risk break down on all counterparts. Agree this is more complicated than current notions of money.
4. Securitisation markets. Package up IOUs into tranches. Traders can speculate on various levels of credit quality.
5. Sensible reputation management. Non-invasive performance tracking of debtors. Did they meet margin requirements? Did they meet all coupon payments? Etc. Can also take into account degree of co-operation with other users, for example do they accommodate restructuring and help others meet their liabilities?<p>I don&#x27;t like crypto because there&#x27;s essentially zero accountability for issuers and that kind of environment is optimal for scammers. Crypto behaves like synthetic equity&#x2F;commodity instruments with no accountable issuers. In contrast, with a credit based system, issuers are responsible for their issued liabilities and are expected to make good on them. In crypto, no-one thinks in terms of liabilities and so you get ridiculous projects like &quot;Synthentix&quot; who are collateralising a USD Stablecoins with their own issued tokens. For anyone with a basic understanding of financial risk and accounting, their approach is mad.<p>A credit based system is fairer because anyone can issue credit and the onus in on issuers to ensure they have the necessary reputation for others to accept their credit. Furthermore, credit-like instruments are natural Stablecoins - providing all agree on a numeraire, the value of credit is a function of credit risk which can be successfully managed in most cases.",finance,,finance

1544,"I’m not dumping on Ilhan Omar. I’m dumping on the mostly white people in the media who have made her, in my dad’s words, “the face of American Muslims.” She has views that are far outside the mainstream for American Muslims, particularly with respect to social issues and activism. She’s welcome to have whatever politics she wants—it’s America! But it’s wrong for the media to amplify her as if she is representative of Muslims in America as a whole.<p>This is a problem with progressives, which have disproportionate power in the media, and academia. As a group (for example Elizabeth Warren supporters) they’re as disproportionately white as the Republican Party. But they trade on the moral authority of purporting to speak for people of color. To that end, they amplify voices like Omar and Tlaib, whose politics are indistinguishable from those of secular white progressives, and not representative of Muslims. There are probably more Muslims who voted for Trump (about 1&#x2F;3) then ones who are as extreme in their politics as Omar and Tlaib. This pisses odd people like my parents, who are typical Muslim voters (moderate socially conservative Democrats).<p>It’s particularly problematic when, as the OP points out, whites people are judged differently for amplifying the voices of someone like Omar or Tlaib versus the voice of one of the many Muslims who voted for Trump. It suppresses conservatism within the community—progressive Muslims can count on getting tenure, getting in CNN, because white people are allowed to agree with and amplify them. But when conservative Muslims speak, white people are afraid to agree, and progressive whites often feel comfortable attacking them as tokens. This happens to other people of color as well—in the dozens of Asians you saw on CNN talking about the Atlanta shootings, how many were Trump voters (like 1&#x2F;3 of Asians?)",general,,general

2984,"Nicholas has <i>Waded</i> (pun intended) into the waters of irrational horror over gain-of-function research that seems to <i>gain viral traction</i> following every spill-over event. The only argument presented in the article that leans towards the lab-leak hypothesis is the human-preffered double CGG codon that appears in the furin cleavage site; this is nothing like a smoking gun, IMO. Yesterday&#x27;s TWiV 751 covered a paper <i>The furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is required for transmission in ferrets</i> [1] which has the following abstract:<p>&gt; To investigate the importance of the spike polybasic CS of SARS-CoV-2 (PRRAR), a number of spike mutants predicted to modulate the efficiency of furin cleavage were generated (Fig. 1a), including: substituting two upstream arginines to produce a monobasic CS similar to SARS-CoV spike (monoCS), replacing the tribasic CS with the furin CS of a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza haemagglutinin containing seven basic amino acids (H5CS) and two naturally occurring deletions seen following passage in Vero E6 cells and&#x2F;or in clinical isolates21,26. The first deletion removes eight amino acids including all three arginines of the PRRAR site (ΔCS), while the other removes five flanking amino acids but retains the tribasic CS (Δflank). The mutations were engineered into a spike expression plasmid to enable cell surface expression and generation of coronavirus lentiviral PVs. In addition, to study the importance of the PRRAR motif in the context of live virus, we used a naturally occurring Vero-cell-adapted mutant SARS-CoV-2, ΔCS26. This variant and the wild-type (WT) virus from which it was derived were cloned by limiting dilution to enable studies using individual genotypes.<p>This is the <i>horror</i> of in vitro and in vivo viral lab research and the result is a magnificent advancement of our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the furin cleavage site, and its role in TMPRSS2 assisted membrane entry. This research follows the equally eye-opening paper covered in TWiV 715 that explained why hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) failed; Vero E6 cells lack TMPRRS2 so HCQ fully blocks entry via endocytosis. It should be noted that this study includes MERS-CoV which also has a furin cleavage site; falsifying one of the claims of Wade&#x27;s article.<p>Regardless, lab experiments begin with one or more viral isolates and molecular clock techniques should show that the original Wuhan variant has almost identical non-coding genome segments compared to existing lab isolates. The RaTG13 sequence is a very distant relative using this measure. Also, RaTG13 is not an isolate, only an RNA sample collected in wild bat anal swabs. Conflating viral isolates with RNA samples seems to be a common error; an entry in a genetic database does not imply that a viable viral line exists in a lab. A RaTG13 lab isolate would have been an important achievement to further our scientific understanding.<p>I&#x27;m confused by the dismissals of the natural origins hypothesis. The horseshoe bat roosts, that are studied, are mostly found in or near Kunming, Yunnan. This lush wild area is part of the Lancang&#x2F;Mekong River watershed&#x2F;ecosystem shared by nocturnal bats and nocturnal arboreal mammals like palm civets, pangolins, and raccoon dogs. The nearby villages contain people engaged in guano collection, the wildlife trade, and domestic livestock farming.<p>The average incubation time of COVID-19 is 4.5 days. Armed with Google maps and a basic understanding of planes, trains, and automobiles we can gauge travel time from Kunming Airport to either Wuhan Tianhe International Airport (2 hr 5 min) or Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (2 hrs). In 2003, SARS-1 emerged in Guangzhou (near Hong Kong) and the now demonized Dr. Zheng-li Shi and her team traced the origins to palm civets (the intermediate host). Why is this so hard? Why do we not ridicule the assumption that travel between major Chinese transportation hubs must leave a wake of infections along the path?<p>Finally, Wade&#x27;s article mentions a U.S. State Department claim [2]:<p>&gt; The U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.<p>If true, this is an important early super-spreader event but the remainder of the release consists of a facile analysis performed by people more knowledgeable in geopolitics than science.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-021-00908-w"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-021-00908-w</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2017-2021.state.gov&#x2F;fact-sheet-activity-at-the-wuhan-institute-of-virology&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2017-2021.state.gov&#x2F;fact-sheet-activity-at-the-wuhan...</a>",finance,,general

4357,"Historically the very best software engineers outside the US simply immigrated to the US, joined a Silicon Valley company, and made a good living. The quality of those left behind, who didn’t have the same mobility, was on average lower. So companies didn’t have good reason to open an office elsewhere. This was especially true before the Internet, since collaboration was much more difficult. These days there are probably great engineers in many locations, but it takes time for their local tech economy to catch up to locations with concentrations of employers and employees like Silicon Valley. They need employers to open local offices (attracted by cheaper or better talent), and then for competing employers to also do so, in order to change the supply demand dynamics to favor software engineers. Then their salaries will rise accordingly.<p>Another part of the equation: in today’s age of massive aggregation around a few gigantic tech monopolies in the US, those few companies are able to pay large salaries because they derive a lot of value from their employees. But the reality of compensation is not very dissimilar between the US and other locations once you remove FAANG from the equation.

Maybe you&#x27;ve perused r&#x2F;Startup_Ideas but were overwhelmed by random people&#x27;s musings about dog social networks.

And maybe you&#x27;ve bought some domain names and half-built an idea or two, only to realize it wasn&#x27;t a good enough idea to be worth spending more time on.<p>I believe there are many ways to get good startup ideas.

Although New Jersey’s governor issued his desperate plea for COBOL programmers, later investigations revealed that it was the website through which people filed claims, written in the comparatively much newer programming language Java, that was responsible for the errors, breakdowns, and slowdowns.

100,"My biggest problem using Nix has been minor changes, like the address of upstream sources, rippling down through dependencies. Hopefully this will improve with content addressing, and make it easier to fetching from places like IPFS. As an example:<p>- I wrote a piece of software as part of a research project, which I kept in git and built using Nix.<p>- That tool was generally useful, so I didn&#x27;t want to pollute its repo with my particular experiment scripts&#x2F;results, etc. so I kept those in a separate repo which pinned a particular commit of that tool.<p>- The writeups&#x2F;papers based on these experiments had a lot of churn (as usual), so I kept those in a third git repo, which pinned a particular commit of the experimental results. These writeups did some analysis, generated graphs, etc. which was also managed by Nix.<p>This all worked great, everything was reproducible, identified by unforgable git commit IDs, etc. Then Microsoft bought GitHub and a bunch of people&#x2F;projects deleted their repos (e.g. moving to GitLab, or wherever). That broke the tool&#x27;s build, making the whole chain from tool -&gt; experiment -&gt; paper unreproducible. It was easy enough to fix by swapping the URLs in the .nix files, but that changed the git commit ID; hence the existing experimental data was tied to a commit which didn&#x27;t work.<p>Content-addressing would:<p>- Allow monkey-patching a fix, by letting me declare that both commits produce the same tool (despite their sources containing slightly different .nix files), and hence this change doesn&#x27;t alter the experimental results.<p>- Allow such issues to be prevented, by making it easier to fetch dependencies from content-addressed storage like IPFS, which reduces the reliance on third-party servers keeping URLs alive; e.g. I could keep hosting the desired sources myself.

And a lot of &quot;clever index optimizations&quot; Elasticsearch article talks about is actually at the Lucene&#x27;s level.

I saw you mention &quot;twice as fast&quot; in another reply, something that compares apples to apples would be interesting.

4320,"&gt; An access trough a pointer is less efficient than a direct access<p>But the alternative is <i>not</i> &quot;a direct access.&quot; It&#x27;s <i>a copy and then</i> direct access. A copy, mind you, that occurs <i>through a pointer</i> to grab the original data from the stack position it was sitting in. That&#x27;s the <i>very same</i> indirect read that the callee does in the proposed ABI!<p>Thus, the indirect memory <i>read</i> will happen either way; either at caller copy time (existing ABIs), or at read time (proposed ABI, copy optimized away), or at callee copy time (proposed ABI, copy not optimized away.)<p>The only difference in the number of indirect memory accesses, with the proposed ABI, is that you might be able to avoid an indirect memory <i>write</i> (i.e. of the memory the caller is writing to by doing the copy.)<p>&gt; Finally, who guarantees that the programmer doesn&#x27;t abuse this thing and starts to modify the data without doing the copy on write?<p>Uhh... we&#x27;re not talking about features exposed to the developer. We&#x27;re talking about calling conventions—instructions <i>to the compiler</i> on how to distribute the <i>glue code it generates</i> between the call-sites it builds (&quot;caller-[verb]ed&quot; things) and function prologues&#x2F;epilogues it builds (&quot;callee-[verb]ed&quot; things.)<p>The &quot;copy on write&quot; part here [if you want to call it that—it&#x27;s not &quot;on&quot; write] would be part of such a generated function prologue (&quot;callee-copied&quot;)—the same code that gets generated at the call-site in existing calling conventions (&quot;caller-copied&quot;), just moved to the other side of the linkage. With the important difference that, if the compiler could prove that the callee (or anything it calls, passing the variable, transitively) wasn&#x27;t going to do anything write-like with the data behind the pointer, then the copy in the function prologue could be optimized out.<p>This compiler optimization can only occur if the copy is the callee&#x27;s responsibility. Given external linkage (think: separate compilation units, e.g. calling a function defined in a static library that&#x27;s already compiled and only available in binary form), the caller can&#x27;t guarantee the properties of the callee. But a callee can always guarantee <i>its own</i> properties during function-prologue&#x2F;epilogue generation—since it&#x27;s generating the function prologue&#x2F;epilogue in the very same compiler session that has access to the AST that describes the function&#x27;s static-analysis-proven properties in full.<p>(Yes, this means that a compiler could <i>be mistaken about</i> whether a callee writes through the implicit pointer underneath the passed value, and therefore generate the optimized function prologue when it shouldn&#x27;t. This is known as <i>a compiler bug</i>, and wouldn&#x27;t be something J Random Hacker would ever run into if using a stable, non-alpha release of their compiler, with a stable, non-alpha release of support for this calling convention.)<p>&gt; What cleanliness?<p>The functionality being proposed is that you just pass-by-value (which makes obvious that the semantics your code is enacting is &quot;the function can do whatever it likes with the value, and it won&#x27;t affect the caller, because <i>if it writes</i>, it&#x27;s writing <i>to a copy</i> of the value&quot;); but sometimes it&#x27;ll be automagically faster than it could have otherwise been, because sometimes, when the compiler can prove certain properties, no copy — only an indirect memory read — would be occurring.<p>This allows you to <i>always use pass-by-value</i> when you want those semantics, and to get code that&#x27;s &quot;as optimal as it can be&quot;; rather than having to pass pointers around and explicitly copy-on-write and all that mess in order to get that same level of optimization.<p>(And yes, that&#x27;s the alternative in heavily performance-oriented code like a database&#x27;s tuple materialization logic. You don&#x27;t get to write clean code at the expense of performance.

C is very minimal and embedded developers are very reluctant to use <i>any</i> third party code so you end up with a lot of triangular and square shaped wheels so to speak. On the other hand C++ does offer a lot of nice (and appropriate to use) things that would normally be re-invented in a C codebase, however it offers almost too many things which precipitates weird, wrong, and hard to maintain abstractions.<p>At least in my domain I feel the problem is developers just throwing code at a problem until it compiles and exhibits the expected behavior in the happy path before moving on to the next feature. This leads to the same concept being re-invented multiple times in the same code base in new and exciting ways. After all the goal is not to develop nice abstractions, it&#x27;s to make a product that can be sold.<p>I would say C++ is an amazing language for library authors who are necessarily talented and spend the time to create robust, easy to use, and well thought out abstractions that can make the life of an application developer vastly easier.<p>Of course your mileage my vary as I&#x27;m sure the wider software world doesn&#x27;t have all of the same problems that embedded has.

The centralized nature of the trust involved in these cryptocurrencies being actually at the core of how these currencies operate, as the only viable way to properly incentivize a proof-of-work system.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful to equivocate the trust one places in an open decentralized system with the trust someone puts in a custodian of their money to not run off with it. That&#x27;s like equivocating trusting end-to-end encryption to keep your messages secure with trusting Facebook to keep your messages secure. Sure, in both cases there&#x27;s a risk, but one is based on your understanding of an open system, and the other is based on a guess that the custodian you&#x27;re trusting your data to won&#x27;t choose to or accidentally expose it. Just because the word &quot;trust&quot; can be used for both doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t significant differences between them.<p>I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users doesn&#x27;t seem useful in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>The scalability of this system seems interesting, but I think the scalability upgrades that cryptocurrency is getting from sharding and rollups will keep cryptocurrency scalable enough for human commerce purposes. I wonder if details of this system would be more useful in some kind of scenario of machine swarms bartering with each other, maybe in a situation where a common currency specifically doesn&#x27;t make sense and is undesirable, or where there&#x27;s no reasonable-latency access to the common blockchain because of the isolation of the network. Or maybe there&#x27;s a technique here that&#x27;s useful for cross-currency or cross-blockchain transactions.",web/mobile,,

1314,"I think the idea of money as credit is very interesting (look at my HN comment history for my ramblings on the topic!).<p>&gt; I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users that could steal from you, needing to keep a node online always or trust your money to someone else who does so) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users seems like a large obstacle in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>You are right, these are disadvantages but other than &quot;trust paths&quot; the complexity can be mitigated with:<p>1. Market makers who buy IOUs at a discount and swap them for _their_ IOU which can be more trusted. Essentially you want a little bit of centralisation around parties which are known to always make good on their liabilities. These parties could be fully automated (think like Ethereum DAO) and transparent. In some ways these market makers are like banks of today but instead of lending their credit into existence, like banks do, they require people to buy it (usually) at a premium.<p>2. Insurance or a credit derivatives market so people can hedge against counterparts defaults.<p>3. If everyone agrees on a common numeraire and wallets are sophisticated to show an aggregate balance in that numeraire taking into account credit risk then that could remove much of the complexity for users. Integrated with market makers, you could &quot;auto swap&quot; IOUs to issuers which you prefer. Wallets can also provide a credit risk break down on all counterparts. Agree this is more complicated than current notions of money.<p>4. Securitisation markets. Package up IOUs into tranches. Traders can speculate on various levels of credit quality.<p>5. Sensible reputation management. Non-invasive performance tracking of debtors. Did they meet margin requirements? Did they meet all coupon payments? Etc. Can also take into account degree of co-operation with other users, for example do they accommodate restructuring and help others meet their liabilities?<p>I don&#x27;t like crypto because there&#x27;s essentially zero accountability for issuers and that kind of environment is optimal for scammers. Crypto behaves like synthetic equity&#x2F;commodity instruments with no accountable issuers. In contrast, with a credit based system, issuers are responsible for their issued liabilities and are expected to make good on them. In crypto, no-one thinks in terms of liabilities and so you get ridiculous projects like &quot;Synthentix&quot; who are collateralising a USD Stablecoins with their own issued tokens. For anyone with a basic understanding of financial risk and accounting, their approach is mad.<p>A credit based system is fairer because anyone can issue credit and the onus in on issuers to ensure they have the necessary reputation for others to accept their credit. Furthermore, credit-like instruments are natural Stablecoins - providing all agree on a numeraire, the value of credit is a function of credit risk which can be successfully managed in most cases.",finance,,

That would have been a monumentally stupid move if they weren&#x27;t intending to live up to it.<p>&gt; they put Apple first above everything else<p>A weird accusation. Setting aside immutable truths about the motivations of any corporation, Apple has <i>famously</i> placed their customers ahead of many other external concerns. Case in point—where they have actively defied the wishes of the FBI (and similar arms of many world governments) in the implementation of robust on-device encryption and cryptographic security.<p>&gt; I only see them getting an exclusive view of user behavior on their devices.<p>That&#x27;s an absurd complaint. Who are these other people that you think should have access to my data? <i>Damn right</i> it should be exclusive to Apple—people are paying them good money to be a trustworthy steward of their data.",web/mobile,,

Most transactional memory proposals are not page level granularity - though obviously most proposals have certain limits, and byte level being too granular doesn&#x27;t even make any sense.",general,,

The SS was _not_ the German army. The SS was the military organization of the Nazi party - often conflicting with the army to achieve their goals. They enforced racial policy in Germany and its conquests, ran the concentration camps and death camps, and were specifically tasked with eliminating Jews.<p>Perhaps it is because of the collective guilt of not having done enough for Jews at the time, but people often gloss over the explicitly racial and antisemitic aspect of World War II.

I mean projects and not developers because projects tend to hire like developers and then developers mostly share same problematic quality.  In the end it is not individual contributors who are at fault but management who allowed it to happen.<p>#1. Insufficient programming skills. This where developers don&#x27;t use libraries because they don&#x27;t even know they exist, can&#x27;t recognize the problem they are solving as generic. This is where they can&#x27;t structure the code because they haven&#x27;t seen much code at all and&#x2F;or are not interested in learning.<p>You can recognize this immediately as codebases with a lot of code duplication and very weak structure&#x2F;abstractions.<p>#2. Too much programming ambition. This is where developers think so highly of themselves that they can&#x27;t accept existing off the shelf components and will reinvent them because they can do better. They will write new everything because it will offer 10% performance increase in their specific case or just for the intelectual fun of doing it. They will obsess over ensuring there is no duplication of code at the cost of creating baroque structures that have no meaning and purpose other than ensure that every single component works in every single case supported by the application and in any possible future.<p>You can recognize this as codebases with no duplication but when you try to read the code it seems the structure is so complicated you need to have a huge map on entire wall and a guide to be able to travel the codebase. Most of the objects don&#x27;t have any meaning in the domain of the problem and are just abstract &quot;stuff&quot; necessary to glue everything together.<p>I very much prefer working with case #1<p>The reason is that, as dumb as the code is, you can read it and understand what the author <i>probably</i> had in mind, what the application attempts to do. You can then work with the code, refactor functionality out, and so on.<p>In my experience case #2 is usually beyond repair (or at least beyond my abilities to repair). These developers become easily hostile -- because they think very highly of themselves they treat everybody as inferior and now I am trying to write some dumb unsophisticated code and so I must be dumb. They also tend to change jobs pretty easily so the only result of trying to fix that kind of project is people suddenly leaving it and management getting restless at the lack of progress.<p>And for some reason every single C++ team I worked with falls under case #2.<p>I think because, given so many options, you need to have ambition to willingly choose C++ as your main programming language and so the population is preselected.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are all highly intelligent people.

1981,"Sure, it&#x27;s more an observation of the mechanics underpinning cryptocurrencies. My statement was actually incorrect in that there are not actually &quot;issuers&quot; per se in crypto and that can be a problem.<p>Cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH and whatever else are not &quot;money&quot; in the sense that we generally understand. This money is either a credit on a commercial bank or a credit on a central bank. These entities are responsible for managing the liquidity and solvency of their balance sheet such that the credit you hold retains value (Yes, I know there is inflation but that&#x27;s an orthogonal concern, I would argue). There is a governance and legal framework underpinning how money works in this &quot;mundane World&quot;. Everything in the mundane world is a legal agreement. Financial agreements are always someone&#x27;s liability and that&#x27;s a good thing because someone is always accountable if something goes wrong.<p>Cryptocurrency behaves more like some kind of synthetic commodity. By that I mean that it inherently has no value and has no use for anything other than being a &quot;token&quot;. When cryptocurrency is created, it has no issuer. There&#x27;s no accepted legal framework or explicit governance framework for holding people accountable if something goes wrong (other than code is law) and things go wrong all the time. There are rug pulls, exchange rate crashes and project failures are ten a penny etc... and this is all happening while the crypto world is in a mega bull market! What happens when the next bear market comes around? All the projects that _seem_ viable now will suddenly become unviable. All the debt positions collateralised with sketchy crypto will unwind en masse. I suspect the tokens for many projects out there will trade close to zero. People who invested in various projects from algo stablecoins to lending protocols will suddenly find that they hold worthless tokens with zero recourse. By this point the insiders would have exited into BTC&#x2F;ETH&#x2F;fiat ready to start the next round of &quot;projects&quot;.<p>Maybe this is OK. I mean, it is what it is and clearly some people are fine with that. I think we can do better though. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m interested in credit based monetary systems because reputation is a key part, so participants are accountable for their actions. This is fundamental for any significant real world adoption. Furthermore, credit based instruments do have intrinsic value which is a function of issuer credit risk. Such instruments are more stable than &quot;synthetic commodities&quot; and have more utility for real world uses.<p>Having said all that. I work in the crypto world and quite enjoy it.

Exactly what actionable conclusion depends on knowing if the origin of the virus was a lab or not?<p>There are maybe one in a dozen proponents of the lab theory that are legitimately interested in these questions. For the remaining 11 out of 12, the Wuhan Lab theory is just a belief that they wear in public to signal &quot;China bad&quot;. An alarming number of people think China created the virus and released it on purpose. I once heard someone say China released the virus just to prove that our healthcare system is bad. Let me highlight the absurdity here. This person believes China engineered a virus and then released it on their own people in a city most foreigners were unaware of so that it would eventually make it to the US.

This works on interstates where drivers of passenger vehicles are going 70 to 90 mph and commercial vehicles are going 40 to 60 mph.<p>Similarly, on a surface street with traffic moving anywhere from 0 to 40 mph, cyclists moving 0 to 20 mph can similarly integrate with traffic with faster drivers changing lanes to pass them.<p>&gt; Part of good separate path design is planning the intersections to prevent the sort of crashes you&#x27;re describing.<p>I&#x27;ve read about the designs, but the assumptions that they make do not really hold.  For example, the typical &quot;protected&quot; intersection with curb extensions and an offset assumes that a motorist will look down the bike path to check for cyclists before exiting an intersection while moving at 10 mph.  In reality, drivers aren&#x27;t going to do that.<p>As I noted earlier, this principle works with pedestrians, because, while walking, they&#x27;re moving around 5 feet per second, so seeing a pedestrian 10 feet away from the intersection is pretty easy for a driver making a turn since they really don&#x27;t have to look down the sidewalk.<p>In contrast, a cyclist is moving anywhere from 15 to 30 feet per second.  A cyclist that&#x27;s two seconds away from entering an intersection can be anywhere from 30 to 60 feet away.  This requires a drivers to actually look down the bike path, which isn&#x27;t always going to occur.  The cyclist may assume that the turning driver has seen them, but that assumption is in correct, and the cyclist will have to slow rapidly to avoid a collision.<p>Also, a lot of cyclists, when making use of such infrastructure, believe that they have pedestrian style right of way, meaning that they will do things like ride around the front of a turning vehicle believing that they&#x27;ll stop to avoid a collision instead of just yielding.<p>A typical person takes about a second or so to react to something unexpected.  At 10 mph, the motorist has already covered 16 feet, meaning that they would collide with a cyclist before they have a chance to even press the brake pedal.",general,,

They can rely on western scientists to debunk the lab created hypothesis.  That leaves their own theories about it originated in Italy as the standing theory for their own domestic consumption.

2659,"I started getting Migraine headaches in the late spring at age 17 and continued to get them in the spring&#x2F;fall weekly for about two decades[0].  I remember the age and the season because, up to that point, I had headaches.  What happened that day resulted in a trip to the emergency room, on my insistence; I thought my brain was bleeding[1].  After 4 hours, I was sent home with a note to take two extra strength Tylenol.  And for the 20 years that followed, that was about the quality of treatment I received.<p>Everything, for me, is solved with a medication that is very rarely prescribed for Migraine.  My issue is that I cannot take the usual medications (imitrex, etc).  They are effective, but I lack a gene that is required to flush them from my system correctly and had this effect where 30 minutes after taking the pill I&#x27;d be the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been in my entire life, and about 1.5 hours later, I&#x27;d be miserable ... <i>comical-if-they-weren&#x27;t-happening-to-you</i> mood swings, which almost killed me[2].<p>The thing of it is, I&#x27;ve seen several doctors for this.  After a mess of semi-unrelated circumstances around that event which almost killed me, I ended up on a prescription for Depokote.  It&#x27;s a very old medication, originally prescribed for seizures and I now commonly used off-label for bipolar.  It was prescribed to me with the endorsement of &quot;a few of my patients responded well to this, none of them had side effects, and this is where we&#x27;re at on the list of choices&quot; ... basically, the guy had no confidence it would work, so I didn&#x27;t either.  It was prescribed mid-summer, and I noticed after about a week that I felt like I was carrying around <i>zero</i> anxiety[3], and a number of other fantastic side-effects[4].<p>The whole time, regardless of specialist, there wasn&#x27;t anyone who could give me a really good idea of just what the hell was really going on in my skull.  I&#x27;ll admit, after reading this, I&#x27;m wondering if I really have Migraine or if I don&#x27;t have some other thing (cluster was ruled out).  My triggers are seasonal; and I have bad days when there has been a large shift from high-&gt;low or low-&gt; high.  Interestingly, though, if I get a migraine, I am pretty much insulated from getting another one for about a week, which implies some sort of biological process that is serving some function, since multiple repeats of that trigger, or even much stronger ones, will not cause a second migraine for several days after one already landed.<p>[0] Varying lengths but until I learned to cope with the symptoms, it at least destroyed the entire rest of the remaining day once it hit.  Often remained a day after, as well.<p>[1] I really, <i>really</i>, hated hospitals as a kid.  My parents took me on my insistence because they knew I would only demand to go if I seriously thought I was dying ... even though it was a headache.<p>[2] A combination of medications related to Migraine which I took during an attack (as prescribed) resulted in my serotonin levels sending me to the hospital. It. Was. Bad.<p>[3] I never thought of myself as anxious, and it&#x27;s never been an issue in my life -- that I know of -- that has held me back.  But, holy cow, the difference was <i>stark</i>.<p>[4] For medications with &quot;brain affecting&quot; side-effects, I <i>do not</i> read the label.  My wife takes that responsibility.  My thinking is: (1) placebo&#x2F;nocebo effect is really strong when the thing it effects is emotional&#x2F;personality.

2710,"I started getting Migraine headaches in the late spring at age 17 and continued to get them in the spring&#x2F;fall weekly for about two decades[0].  I remember the age and the season because, up to that point, I had headaches.  What happened that day resulted in a trip to the emergency room, on my insistence; I thought my brain was bleeding[1].  After 4 hours, I was sent home with a note to take two extra strength Tylenol.  And for the 20 years that followed, that was about the quality of treatment I received.<p>Everything, for me, is solved with a medication that is very rarely prescribed for Migraine.  My issue is that I cannot take the usual medications (imitrex, etc).  They are effective, but I lack a gene that is required to flush them from my system correctly.  So 30 minutes after taking the pill I&#x27;d be the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been in my entire life, and about 1.5 hours later, I&#x27;d be miserable.  It was <i>comical-if-they-weren&#x27;t-happening-to-you</i> mood swings, which almost killed me[2].<p>I&#x27;ve seen several doctors for this.  After a mess of semi-unrelated circumstances around that event which almost killed me, I ended up on a prescription for Depokote.  It&#x27;s a very old medication, originally prescribed for seizures and I now commonly used off-label for bipolar.  It was prescribed to me with the endorsement of &quot;a few of my patients responded well to this, none of them had side effects, and this is where we&#x27;re at on the list of choices&quot; ... basically, the guy had no confidence it would work, so I didn&#x27;t either.  It was prescribed mid-summer, and I noticed after about a week that I felt like I was carrying around <i>zero</i> anxiety[3], and a number of other fantastic side-effects[4].  By the end of the following spring, I was convinced it worked -- completely.  It was the first year I had gone any season without a single Migraine headache.  Interestingly, I&#x27;d get the &quot;aura&quot;, on occasion, but it would never melt into horrifying pain.<p>The whole time, regardless of specialist, there wasn&#x27;t anyone who could give me a really good idea of just what the hell was really going on in my skull.  I&#x27;ll admit, after reading this, I&#x27;m wondering if I really have Migraine or if I don&#x27;t have some other thing (cluster was ruled out).  My triggers are seasonal; and I have bad days when there has been a large shift from high-&gt;low or low-&gt; high.  Interestingly, though, if I get a migraine, I am pretty much insulated from getting another one for about a week, which implies some sort of biological process that is serving some function, since multiple repeats of that trigger, or even much stronger ones, will not cause a second migraine for several days after one already landed.<p>[0] Varying lengths but until I learned to cope with the symptoms, it at least destroyed the entire rest of the remaining day once it hit.  Often remained a day after, as well.<p>[1] I really, <i>really</i>, hated hospitals as a kid.  My parents took me on my insistence because they knew I would only demand to go if I seriously thought I was dying ... even though it was a headache.<p>[2] A combination of medications related to Migraine which I took during an attack (as prescribed) resulted in my serotonin levels sending me to the hospital. It. Was. Bad.<p>[3] I never thought of myself as anxious, and it&#x27;s never been an issue in my life -- that I know of -- that has held me back.  But, holy cow, the difference was <i>stark</i>.<p>[4] For medications with &quot;brain affecting&quot; side-effects, I <i>do not</i> read the label.  My wife takes that responsibility.  My thinking is: (1) placebo&#x2F;nocebo effect is really strong when the thing it effects is emotional&#x2F;personality.

2845,"Unfortunately, I do not remember right now some good titles, but there are various books about comparative linguistics, which analyze the similarities and differences between languages and the various existing ways of expressing the same content.<p>Most ancient languages, including most ancient Indo-European languages, like Latin or Ancient Greek, allowed a free order of the words, because there were markers for each syntactic role, like agent, patient, instrument, beneficiary and so on (i.e. the so-called cases).<p>Nevertheless, at the stage where the old Indo-European languages became attested in writing, they had a very serious defect. Even if the so-called case terminations of the words were originally a small set of post-positions corresponding to the syntactic roles, due to various phonetic evolutions conditioned by the adjacent sounds present in words, the original small set of markers had diverged into a very large set of word terminations with many distinct variants for each syntactic role, the so-called word declensions.<p>Because remembering such a large set of word terminations became too difficult, most modern European languages have abandoned the old declensions. Some languages use enough prepositions, possibly together with some remnants of the old case terminations, to allow a free order of the words.<p>English however, depends a lot on the standard order of the words to convey their syntactic roles and it has only limited means of expression for supporting a different word order.<p>While in the Indo-European languages the too irregular word declensions could not persist, there are other language families with a much more regular structure for the syntactic role markers, while still having enough markers to allow a free word order.<p>It is weird that the European linguists of the previous centuries considered the regular languages (the so-called agglutinative languages or isolant languages) as &quot;primitive&quot; while considering the &quot;flexionar&quot; classic Indo-European languages as &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot;.<p>In fact even if the flexionar classic Indo-European languages evolved from some older agglutinative language, their irregular declensions were a serious defect and not a sign of progress.<p>Unfortunately, because the language changes have always been done mostly by the less educated people, without having any kind of grand plan of how to best improve the language, the necessary simplifications of the language have also been frequently accompanied by a loss of expressiveness, like in English.",web/mobile,,

The combat especially leaves a lot to be desired.<p>As an example, apparently if you die during the intro sequence you have to replay it from the beginning.  I forget exactly how long the intro sequence is, but it&#x27;s probably ~15 minutes.  So yeah, imagine re-playing 15 minutes of mostly non-interactive game.  Yikes.  (But jokes on all the players, you _do_ have to replay that intro sequence multiple times because of the different endings :P)<p>It&#x27;s the story that makes the game great.

They&#x27;ll hide really huge twists and revelations as easily missed off-handed comments.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that the story feels really weak until you discover all those little details and piece all the twists together.  And that doesn&#x27;t happen until the last act or so.  I spent the vast majority of the game thinking X, Y, and Z scenes were really dumb until their context was finally revealed.<p>I can appreciate that type of storytelling.  It&#x27;s different and more complex than I guess most &quot;Western&quot; writing.  But it&#x27;s hard to escape the taint it puts on most of my time with the game.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m not writing this to convince you personally to rethink your experience with the game.  Like I said, if the story doesn&#x27;t work for someone, Automata is an awful game.

As it stands, the presence of distinct symbols in the IPA seems governed by whether there are examples of real-world languages in which phones are considered contrastive. This is perfectly pragmatic, but it leaves me feeling disappointed that I can&#x27;t easily express something that is right there on the chart!

Whether the companies that became dominant were founded by younger or older people is irrelevant to the argument.<p>The main point I took away from this article is that the younger people today, Millenials if you will, are not used to an open internet, so they see the internet as a closed gate community, a divisive force. A completely different view of the Internet than the previous generation had. And as the younger people are the ones with the most energy to fight against what they perceive as injustices, they tend to actually dominate policy making even if indirectly, and what they see as the enemy is things like encryption and even privacy, which the previous generation saw as essential for a free Internet.<p>I agree completely with that, but I am not optimistic as the author is that GenXers will at some point get their act together and make the internet more open again. I believe what will happen is that the Internet will continue being this divisive force until legislation (pushed by younger people who don&#x27;t know better) is introduced to curtail freedom of expression and remove all privacy in the name of justice.

3471,"&gt; The only way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics—Paul Halmos<p>Paul Halmos taught for two years in the 1970s at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was an undergraduate majoring in linguistics. I was also interested in math, and I ended up taking three courses from him: an introduction to mathematical logic, with about twenty students; a seminar on set theory and the foundations of arithmetic, with four or five students; and a one-on-one tutorial on point-set topology.<p>For the latter two courses, he taught based on his “do mathematics” principle. He would provide us with definitions of basic concepts and then have us work through a series of not-so-difficult problems that led eventually to proofs of the major theorems. He let us do most of the work ourselves, though if we got stuck he would provide pointers to help us keep moving ahead. His method was inspired by that of Robert Lee Moore [1], though Halmos was not as hard-assed about it as Moore reportedly was [2]. In the seminar, he encouraged the students to work together.<p>More than forty years later, I remember many details of the two problem-based courses, while the first course, in which he lectured on mathematical logic, has mostly slipped from my memory.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Moore_method"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Moore_method</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk&#x2F;Extras&#x2F;Halmos_Moore_method&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk&#x2F;Extras&#x2F;Halmos_Moore_me...</a>",OS,,

Celestial objects were described as moving in circles, because perfect circular motion was considered an innate property of objects that existed in the uncorrupted realm of the celestial spheres. The theory of impetus, the ancestor to the concepts of inertia and momentum, was developed along similar lines by medieval philosophers such as John Philoponus and Jean Buridan. Motions below the lunar sphere were seen as imperfect, and thus could not be expected to exhibit consistent motion. More idealized motion in the &quot;sublunary&quot; realm could only be achieved through artifice, and prior to the 17th century, many did not view artificial experiments as a valid means of learning about the natural world. Physical explanations in the sublunary realm revolved around tendencies. Stones contained the element earth, and earthly objects tended to move in a straight line toward the centre of the earth (and the universe in the Aristotelian geocentric view) unless otherwise prevented from doing so.[25]<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_physics#Medieval_Europe"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_physics#Medieval_Eu...</a><p>That was what the best of humanity could come up with over 2 millennia.

On some architectures you could even just zero-initialize the stack pointer, and it will roll over to the end of memory on the first push.<p>You can also use the same machine code instructions that make array indexing efficient to access variables on the stack (load&#x2F;store with literal offset,) without having to support signed offsets which would have effectively wasted a precious bit in a very common opcode.<p>When you overrun a buffer, it is more likely to cause your program to crash by corrupting the stack. This is bad in modern times for obvious security reasons, but pragmatically it would have been a useful &quot;feature&quot; in the early days of programming.<p>It pairs nicely with the semantics of a semaphore, where you decrement to acquire and increment to release.<p>The stack pointer conceptually points to valid memory, rather than pointing to invalid memory adjacent to valid memory. This likely has some favorable traits when it comes to how an architecture implements function calls. For example, RET could load the value at the stack pointer into the program counter, then increment the stack pointer. Loading from memory often takes multiple cycles compared to incrementing a register, and this starts the load a cycle earlier than otherwise for the same amount of combinatorial logic.",web/mobile,,

And in a lot of places, user experience is outright horrible because of the restrictions. Have you ever tried to move music from files to the music app? You can&#x27;t. So I have music on my iPhone I basically cannot play. Same for videos. And a lot of data handling is awkward at least. With all their power through the App Store, Apple should insist that all apps which have some sort of local data also support the files app. That all apps which play video properly support picture in picture (most don&#x27;t or differently). Not to mention, that there isn&#x27;t even the most basic, even if completely sandboxed, shell application.

But also flaws in the execution by Apple are responsible for a lot of things which are exactly not good user experience. At a minimum, they should try hard at improving the developer experience.

3607,"&gt; This is largely a myth, please provide an namespace-related CVE that has gone unpatched to support your argument.<p>What I mean is that if you use LXC namespace&#x27;s as a container it is going to be an insecure container. Simply because LXC namespace&#x27;s are not containers and are not going to provide a fully isolated environment. Namespace&#x27;s are low-level building blocks which, together with other technologies (for example a virtualized network stack), you can use to make fully isolated containers. And that&#x27;s why most hosters just took a shortcut and put the whole thing in a hardware VM to ensure tenants are fully isolated. Which I think is a shame since you also get all the overhead of a hardware VM.<p>So sure, you can _make_ something like jails or zones on Linux if you combine a bunch of things and provide the glue. But there is no concept of a container like jails or zones in Linux. Which leads to other problems such as there not being any tooling to mange the (non-existant) container.<p>&gt;  The reason they run as VMs is that hypervisors run on ring 0 and require higher privileges than the kernel, therefore they are naturally more secure.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I fully understand what your saying here but I think you mean that with a type 2 hypervisor the hypervisors kernel runs in a more privileged mode on the CPU then the virtualized kernels it manages and that provides additional security?<p>I don&#x27;t really see how a type 2 hypervisor would conceptually give additional security in regards to a type 1 hypervisor (where a single kernel can provide multiple OS instances such a FreeBSD with Jails or Solaris &#x2F; Illumos with Zones). Everything that is not the &quot;main&quot; kernel always executes in a less privileged mode then the kernel executing them on the CPU. For example no user process executes on Ring 0 on a &quot;normal&quot; (ie. non-hypervisor) OS. With containers this is no different.

4109,"I was once going to write 20,000 words or so on this question, but haven&#x27;t gotten to it yet.<p>Crawl is much newer, much more actively developed, much more prone to radically change from version to version, much less based on learning details through experience, much more helpful to the player in the UI (both in terms of features like autoexplore, autofight, autotravel, and item search, and in terms of proactively prompting you to avoid accidentally doing wasteful or pointless actions).<p>NetHack is older, funnier, prioritizes and facilitates obscure knowledge on the player&#x27;s part more (e.g., complicated techniques for identifying items that require memorization), has more complicated interactions between and among items, players, and the environment (e.g. many more distinct ways to use a given item), and is crueler both in terms of unavoidable deaths (&quot;The spikes were poisoned. The poison was deadly.&quot;) and in terms of allowing the player to take actions that foreseeablely result in waste or instant death.<p>Crawl has more replay value in terms of different ways to win [i.e., not having a standardized set of items that you need to collect and use], and even different definitions of what counts as winning [i.e., you can choose to collect anywhere from 3 to 15 runes]. Both games have conduct challenges of various kinds to make the game even harder.<p>In NetHack, unidentified scrolls are somewhat more dangerous than unidentified potions; in Crawl, unidentified potions are uniformly more dangerous than unidentified scrolls. :-)<p>In NetHack, obscure game knowledge that you acquired twenty years ago is still extremely valuable. In Crawl, it is probably already long obsolete and likely refers to monsters, items, or dungeon branches that no longer even exist in the modern game.<p>The two games famously differ in their approach to spoilers. In NetHack, the game almost never reveals any quantitative or concretely practical information about the purpose or effect of something, and even things like weapon hit percentages and relative efficacy traditionally are considered spoilers. In Crawl, the online help system will, in recent versions, even reveal your current exact hit probability against a particular enemy and the enemy&#x27;s hit probability against you, as well as what kinds of attacks and resistances each of you has (and you can also learn more about <i>why</i>, if you want). In NetHack you even need comparatively rare items to learn with certainty what resistances <i>you</i> have at a particular moment; in Crawl you can pull this up on a convenient screen at any moment.<p>Religion is dramatically more important (and complicated!) in Crawl, and different gods significantly change your play style. In NetHack there are minor differences related to your god&#x27;s alignment which you would probably not need to think about in a typical game; there are always exactly 3 gods, of 3 distinct alignments, in a NetHack game.<p>Item identification (and modification) is much more important in NetHack. Artifacts (special, unique items with abilities different from their base type) are rare and you might find or use something like 1-4 of them in a typical NetHack game. In Crawl, they&#x27;re extremely widespread and you might find or use several dozen in a game, including ending up equipping 100% artifact weapons, armor, and jewelry by the end.<p>Your character class is more consequential in Crawl (there are comparatively larger differences in skills and intrinsics that result from it), though in NetHack it does result in a single completely unique per-character-class dungeon branch in each game.<p>As an example of the UI helpfulness difference: if you try to walk into lava in NetHack:<p>&gt; You fall into the lava! Your small shield bursts into flame! Your pair of leather gloves bursts into flame! You burn to a crisp...<p>In Crawl:<p>&gt; Why would you want to do that?<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s less than 600 words, but I hope it&#x27;s useful!<p>Edit: I like the sibling comment&#x27;s observation that Crawl is &quot;not simulation-y&quot;. To take one example, NetHack developers have thought a lot about gravity and circumstances where you or some object falls on top of you or some object or some trap and exactly what should happen then. And they&#x27;ve thought about what would, or wouldn&#x27;t, cause flasks to shatter or eggs to break, and what the consequences of that would be, and so on. Crawl basically doesn&#x27;t care about this: yes, if you stop flying and thereby fall into an unsurvivable place, you will die. Otherwise, nothing in Crawl ever falls on anything, and nothing ever shatters from impact. The extreme number of physical interactions that are simulated in Dwarf Fortress, and the resulting chains of causality, were reportedly inspired by NetHack. Dwarf Fortress has taken this much further and made the number of interactions radically larger, but NetHack does have this kind of flavor.<p>In Crawl, if you&#x27;re telling someone why you died, it&#x27;s generally &quot;a monster hit me and I died from the resulting damage&quot; (maybe with a surrounding tactical context about why you misjudged the fight). In NetHack, it could very often be something like &quot;I did X, which caused Y to happen, which caused Z to happen, which then killed me instantly&quot;. (Crawl requires you to have 0 or fewer hit points in order to die, except from starvation in older versions that tracked hunger and satiety; in NetHack there are probably 100 different ways to die other than by taking hit-point damage. Maybe 6 or 7 just related to drawbridges...)",AI/Data Science,,

4093,"Sure, dynamical ingredients like the jets carrying huge amount of luminous matter out of active galactic nuclei or the outflow from star forming activities and supernovae, for instance, have been raised as possible explanations for the apparently shallow increase in density of dark matter in galaxy cores (the &quot;cuspiness&quot; problem).   Roughly, dynamical process in cores can -- simply by gravitational interaction -- throw dark matter back out towards the halo along with the luminous matter.<p>One can also step up a scale level and consider that the distribution of peculiar velocities in galaxy clusters is consistent with plenty of dark matter inside galaxy clusters but outside galaxy halos.   This DM is bound to be stirred up by the moving galaxies, even if only gravitationally, and such dynamical processes will also affect the density of gas and dust in the cores of galaxy clusters (the cores of which need not be occupied by galaxies) too.<p>We need to explain peculiar motion of galaxy-cluster-members, and member-galaxy-vs-whole-cluster lensing behaviour too, and astronomical surveys of galaxies and clusters continue to provide plenty of data to test various theoretical approaches.  Those are what propose observable consequences of self-interaction (is there dark chemistry?  do dark matter particles collide and annihilate?) or is dark matter warmer than cold dark matter (if it&#x27;s a naturally warm gas, then it would have a hard time gathering in the cores of galaxies and clusters, much like a warm gas has trouble gathering on the floor of a laboratory compared to a very cold gas).  Or does it couple non-gravitationally but very weakly to baryons or electrons, such that it undergoes a phase change as one goes from the very dense cores of galaxies and gas-rich clusters towards the sparser edges?    If one proposes atmosphere-like dynamical processes at these scales, what are the observables one expects from astronomic spectroscopy?<p>Spirals are certainly interesting, but there are also elliptical galaxies where the outermost hydrogen gas is in arbitrary orbit in clouds of various sizes; unlike edge-on spirals, they don&#x27;t show a advancing-side&#x2F;receding-side red&#x2F;blueshift dipole, and where the rotating elements are large enough to measure significant dipoles, they do not strongly correlate with oblateness.    More intriguingly, the measurable red&#x2F;blue shift velocities of (groups of) stars within such galaxies are mostly <i>radial</i>, which is very different from what&#x27;s seen in spirals, where rotation dominates.    That radial speed is different from what would be seen if the luminous elements (including that that is luminous in infrared, radio, and so on, or material that produces absorption lines rather than emission ones) were all that determined these orbits.    But a cold dark matter halo explains -- or at least is in concord with -- those orbital velocity anomalies.<p>And as galaxy surveys continue, neat things like giant low-surface-brightness galaxies (and their substructures) will be found more often.  Their properties are good stress-tests of dark matter theories and alternatives, in that they should generate predictions for observations which will arrive within the next few years.  They are also probes of largest-scale structure formation, as so far they are not found in or near dense galaxy clusters.   If we start discovering GLSBs in dense regions, that would be a challenge to largest-scale distribution of dark matter as the driver of the cosmic web, which is the best current explanation of the distribution of galaxy clusters that are not gravitationally-bound with one another.",general,,

It’s probably best forgotten.<p>Marilyn Vos Savant published an incorrect answer to the Monte Hall problem. She got the correct answer from a lot of readers, including me. She then published a second incorrect answer claiming that all the letters she got—including from math PhDs were wrong. Finally she got the answer right—the one she undoubtedly got from any math PhD or intelligent person who wrote her—but continued to claim (a) that her previous answers were correct and (b) that all the letters were wrong.<p>As a result, the public is mostly misinformed about this simple problem.<p>The set-up is simple. There are three doors, one of which has a valuable prize behind it, and two of which have worthless prizes. You select one door. The host opens one of the other two doors to show you a worthless prize, and offers you the opportunity to switch your choice.<p>The key to this problem, which Marilyn finally saw in her third solution, is the knowledge and intentions of the host. If the host doesn’t know which door has the prize, there’s no reason to switch or not switch, it’s the same either way. If the host knows the door and is trying to hurt you, don’t switch. If the host knows the door and is trying to help you, switch.<p>Marilyn’s first answer was to always switch, regardless of the host’s intentions. This is also the answer that most people now believe. It’s a common error that people make all the time. That’s why people wrote in to correct her.<p>In order to justify her incorrect first answer, she claimed it was obvious that the host used the strategy of always opening a non-prize door and offering you the chance to switch. This does indeed justify switching. But that assumption was missing from her first and second answers, along with any discussion of the host’s knowledge and intentions mattering.<p>Her justification that the assumptions were too obvious to need stating was the actual television program Let’s Make a Deal, hosted by Monte Hall, which eventually gave the name to the problem. But anyone who watched the show knew that was not Monte’s strategy. Sometimes he opened another door and gave a chance to switch, sometimes he didn’t. He was well aware of the problem if he followed Marilyn’s assumed strategy, and was scrupulous about not giving any advantage to the contestant. You can tell this from statistics on the show—on average it didn’t pay to switch—and his published statements.<p>Clearly there are much bigger problems in the world, and it doesn’t pay to get upset about misinformation put out by popular vain people.

Economic study of cooperative model within capitalism has shown the to be mostly not effective and not innovative. Success stories are few an far between and those that do exist usually are successful by copying existing business model.<p>There is a reason less then 1% of companies operate that way.<p>&gt; Meanwhile capitalism promotes top down decision making, and necessarily leads to centralization and monopolies.<p>Funny, if you read Marx you would assume that there would be less companies over time and an workers getting poor consistently.<p>The exact opposite has happened.<p>the idea that capitalism lead to top down decision making is frankly incredibly false. Within each company there is some level of top down decision making, but every company has a different culture and many different types of companies have success.<p>Some companies are large stock holder conglomerates where there is very little top down decision making and each sub-company operates mostly by themselves. Some companies are run by a visionary leader in a more top-down fashion but the good once take advice and ideas.<p>And on system level the idea that decision making in capitalism is top-down is simply verifiable and completely untrue. The highest political authority clearly does not set prices, in fact often when they do they fail and they clearly don&#x27;t make the economic choices for everybody.<p>Ok, lets go to the evil capitalist. Do they make all the choices? No clearly not. Even the richest capitalist only control small parts of companies that themselves are far less then % of the economy. And even the price and worth of those companies are defined in a decentralized way.<p>Meanwhile, not a single anarchy-syndicalist or even syndicalist system has ever actually worked for a modern economy for any length of time. The counter examples that Socialist often bring up, Basque country in the Spanish Civil war and so on are embracing examples of reaching compared to the global economy.<p>&gt; The game of monopoly is a perfect illustration of this where every player starts in a fair position and over time all the power ends up being consolidated with a single player while the rest of the players lose everything.<p>Monopoly the game was designed by a socialist to impose his idea of capitalism the form of a game. Its literally a game design to show how evil capitalism is.<p>But a little tip from me, don&#x27;t make up your philosophy based on a propaganda board game. All it shows that the guy who invented the board game is just as wrong as you.<p>&gt; This dynamic plays out in the real world as well. As companies compete, successful companies grow while unsuccessful ones die out or end up being absorbed by ones that are successful. As the company grows the amount of initial capital needed to compete with it grows as well. It&#x27;s pretty much impossible for a small startup to start competing with a company like Walmart or Amazon because these companies leverage advantages like economies of scale and brand recognition.<p>Funny how Walmart already existed when Amazon was created. Funny how IBM existed when Microsoft was created. The examples are literally countless.<p>You are literally using as an example, a company that is 25 years old. It existence proves that you are wrong. If your theory was actually correct, Amazon could never have been created in the first place.<p>Its always amazing to who socialism have predicted that all capitalism will centralize into one single big company, and after 200 years and the number of companies generally increasing they still make the exact same arguments. This does make a certain sense since socialism have for 200 years believed everything run by a single top-down operation would be the most efficient.<p>&gt; If we look at capitalist economies we can see that monopolies and cartels are prevalent in pretty much every domain from telecom industry to food production to media and most other domains.<p>And Tom Hanks has monopoly on playing Tom Hanks. Hollywood is full of monopolies.<p>If funny, you just divide up the whole market in to arbitrarily sized sub-markets, then declare each a monopoly.

4174,"&gt; First off I want to note TI calculators are not anything special when it comes to assembler. It was more of a limitation of the platform (in order to get games that are fast, you had to write them in assembler because TI-BASIC was too slow).<p>&gt; Note also that assembly code is different for each CPU architecture. The TI calculator I had contained a z80 chip, so it was z80 assembler (Motorola assembler?). The x86 assembly language is a more complicated, but probably more useful to learn (can look at any program on your computer). Or maybe you could learn ARM assembly (e.g. this would allow you to write simple programs that blink lights on a Raspberri PI).<p>Sure, I understand all this already. I suspect that x86 assembly might be most useful for me, but I also have access to an Arduino, so I might try writing assembly for that as well.<p>&gt; 1.

At Utrecht University, they shone light through a layer of zinc oxide nanopowder deposited on a glass slide.

Once this has been done, Rotter explains, you can calculate “what kind of wave would be transmitted through this medium in the same way as through fresh space”.<p>So it&#x27;s not just any opaque material (and it&#x27;s not even &quot;opaque&quot;, really), and it&#x27;s not just any waveform.

The call-sites of the function look the same whether or not the function does the copy.<p>• The compiler, by static analysis of the function, determines whether the function really <i>needs</i> a copy—i.e. whether it would <i>make a difference</i> to the code whether the copying ever happens.<p>• If it needs a copy, then the compiler generates the function to have a prologue that does a copy <i>from</i> the address in the caller-passed register <i>to</i> the address in the stack pointer; and then the compiler generates code that interacts with the copy as a local stack variable. (Because, after the copy, it is!)<p>• But if the function <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> actually &quot;need&quot; a copy, then the compiler generates no copy in the function prologue, and generates code for the function body that interacts with the original indirectly through the passed address in the register.&quot;<p>This has nothing-at-all to do with copy &quot;on&quot; write. This is &quot;copy <i>now</i>, if we can&#x27;t guarantee there <i>won&#x27;t</i> be a write <i>later</i>.&quot;<p>Which is already what compilers do. That&#x27;s what &quot;pass by value&quot; <i>means</i>.

But if we “reverse it” and the host opens the door first and you guess second, your probability improves to 1&#x2F;99. So now suddenly the same information is relevant. Two things to observe here, one is that the forward and reverse problems are different, the other is that the relevance or irrelevance of the information depends on the direction of time.  If you learn the information before you act it is relevant, afterward it is irrelevant.<p>One way to think about Monty Hall is you’re deciding which of these games to play.  If you will stick with your first decision, you are sorta turning it into the toy problem above, where you decide the door first and then the goat information is irrelevant. Vs if you will switch, the goat door is opened before you decide, which is relevant.<p>Another way to think about it is with two contestants. Let’s say I pick the door initially, then someone opens the goat door, and finally you decide whether to switch. In this scenario, you don’t have self-preference bias to stick with “my” original door. In fact, my decision was the irrelevant information. It doesn’t matter at all what door I picked, what matters is whether you pick the right door, and involving me at all is a kind of misdirection to anchor you to the 1&#x2F;3 probability.",devops/OS,,

One may also think that such cases have many causes, just like most major technological disasters result from a chain of causes (multiple and redundant safeties, however in some rare cases something isn&#x27;t properly handled).
A main cause may be that speaking up about a criminal colleague is only possible if you know for sure that he is guilty, meaning that you probably are a witness, and in such a case a colleague of the culprit.  There are many reasons for teammates to cover-up each other.  For example they may all be guilty of something (establishing a &quot;popular culture of corruption&quot;), or they may think that their colleague is guilty but should be pardoned given his merits (somewhat acting as judges).  Some configurations of the rotten apple&#x27;s team forbid any upper stratum (department, union, community...) to work adequately, as they will systematically amplify the testimony of those teammates.<p>You don&#x27;t have &quot;one bad cop&quot;, but rather a non-neglectable probability for his teammates to avoid speaking out about his reprehensible acts, and also unreasonable hopes about the ability of upper strata to attain to the truth.<p>In theory we may alleviate this by establishing larger teams and&#x2F;or frequently changing (rotating) their members, hoping that it will reduce complicit distortions.

4462,"Eh, I am not so sure.  After watching my kid go through Suzuki Method violin through Volume 10 (a Mozart concerto) -- my observation is that it is incredibly important to not practice-in mistakes.  The typical Suzuki Method attack is to identify &quot;special spots&quot; (you don&#x27;t tell a 4-year old that it is a &quot;difficult section&quot;) and for those special spots, identify drills that work that spot.  The spot is probably 1 or 2 measures long.  There are a lot of different technique-builder drills, but one example: In La Folia there is a challenging run, at performance tempo it is very fast, and the timing is a 7-tuple, if I recall.  One drill is to play that scale run forwards and backwards, slowly, concentrating on perfect intonation, even timing, and percussive finger landings.  Only when that drill is perfect, is that integrated into the piece.<p>So, no.  Don&#x27;t allow yourself to make mistakes.  Take the challenging section, come up with a drill for just that section, and work that section until it is perfect at the same tempo where you can play the rest of the piece.  The first rule of time-efficient practice is to spend your time on the sections that need perfecting!  Just playing the piece through over-and-over is not a good use of practice time.<p>Another thing that I found a bit mind-bending, given my own music education, is that our teacher had the philosophy that first you memorize the piece, and only after the piece is completely memorized without intonation and tempo mistakes, is it possible to start really working on perfecting it. That is the point where she really started teaching the piece. Maybe that is a violinist thing where there is a culture of memorization, but it was a bit of a new concept for me.<p>Another teacher at a violin camp used to say: &quot;After you first succeed, try, try again.&quot;  Meaning, don&#x27;t stop after you get it right!  After you get it right, you need to play it correctly at least as many times as you played it incorrectly, just to reach net-zero learning.

This leads to them depleting their savings (mostly held up in &quot;safe&quot; investments that aren&#x27;t expected to grow or shrink much over the relevant timespan) at some rate so that it gets close to $0 by the time they can expect to die. Some older people have already made it long enough to go past that point, and they get into the same situations that retirees without any savings get into. i.e. you hear about old ladies subsisting on dog food because their only source of income is a small social security check.<p>A better mindset is the one used by the FIRE crowd, which applies just as well if you&#x27;re &quot;retired&quot; at 30 or 60: recognize index funds are not just pretty safe but also give a pretty high confidence minimal rate of return, plan for average x% returns per year, <i>and don&#x27;t withdraw more than x%</i> for income, so that your savings never decreases but in fact increases. This way you can retire whenever your savings hits the right number to support your required income indefinitely, rather than retiring when your savings hits the right number to provide income only for the next X years until you die.<p>(I shouldn&#x27;t have to say it but will: this is a theoretical optimal modeling strategy, reality will be messier, any real plan should analyze possible setbacks and ways to deal with them -- the easiest way typically being to seek work again for some period of time, which tends to be easier the more biologically young you are.

If you start out correctly, the rest will follow, and IME, sight reading greatly improves as well.<p>&gt; [...] you may reach a point where you can’t play any faster, no matter how hard you try. What is likely happening is that the hand motions you are using—which come naturally at the slower tempo you started with—simply will not work at such high speeds.<p>This is completely true, for instance, in ragtime, the left hand makes big, quick jumps and there is often no time to look at where it will land (which one likely does when playing slowly), so repeating a bar over and over again to incrementally refine your distance estimate is crucial.<p>This applies to things like typing on a keyboard as well, if you focus on correct finger placement (and correct use of the 4th and 5th fingers), your WPM might take a hit for a few days or a week, but in the long term it really helps.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=po_a1SmZKLs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=po_a1SmZKLs</a>",web/mobile,,

It is a generalization in any number of dimensions of the three-dimensional polyhedron. Polytopes may exist in any general number of dimensions n as an n-dimensional polytope or n-polytope. Flat sides mean that the sides of a (k+1)-polytope consist of k-polytopes that may have (k−1)-polytopes in common. For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope.&quot;<p>[...]<p>Polytopes in lower numbers of dimensions have standard names:<p>Dimension

It is named after H.S.M. Coxeter.[1]&quot;<p>Definitions<p>Note that this article assumes a finite Coxeter group. For infinite Coxeter groups, there are multiple conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements, and they have infinite order.<p>There are many different ways to define the Coxeter number h of an irreducible root system.<p>A Coxeter element is a product of all simple reflections. The product depends on the order in which they are taken, but different orderings produce conjugate elements, which have the same order.<p>The Coxeter number is the order of any Coxeter element;.
The Coxeter number is 2m&#x2F;n, where n is the rank, and m is the number of reflections. In the crystallographic case, m is half the number of roots; and 2m+n is the dimension of the corresponding semisimple Lie algebra.
If the highest root is ∑miαi for simple roots αi, then the Coxeter number is 1 + ∑mi.
The Coxeter number is the highest degree of a fundamental invariant of the Coxeter group acting on polynomials.&quot;<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coxeter_element#Coxeter_plane"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coxeter_element#Coxeter_plane</a><p>&gt;&quot;For a given Coxeter element w, there is a unique plane P on which w acts by rotation by 2π&#x2F;h. This is called the Coxeter plane[6] and is the plane on which P has eigenvalues e2πi&#x2F;h and e−2πi&#x2F;h = e2πi(h−1)&#x2F;h.[7] This plane was first systematically studied in (Coxeter 1948),[8] and subsequently used in (Steinberg 1959) to provide uniform proofs about properties of Coxeter elements.[8]<p>The Coxeter plane is often used to draw diagrams of higher-dimensional polytopes and root systems – the vertices and edges of the polytope, or roots (and some edges connecting these) are orthogonally projected onto the Coxeter plane, yielding a Petrie polygon with h-fold rotational symmetry.[9] For root systems, no root maps to zero, corresponding to the Coxeter element not fixing any root or rather axis (not having eigenvalue 1 or −1), so the projections of orbits under w form h-fold circular arrangements[9] and there is an empty center, as in the E8 diagram at above right. For polytopes, a vertex may map to zero, as depicted below. Projections onto the Coxeter plane are depicted below for the Platonic solids.<p>In three dimensions, the symmetry of a regular polyhedron, {p,q}, with one directed Petrie polygon marked, defined as a composite of 3 reflections, has rotoinversion symmetry Sh, [2+,h+], order h. Adding a mirror, the symmetry can be doubled to antiprismatic symmetry, Dhd, [2+,h], order 2h. In orthogonal 2D projection, this becomes dihedral symmetry, Dihh, [h], order 2h.<p>In four dimensions, the symmetry of a regular polychoron, {p,q,r}, with one directed Petrie polygon marked is a double rotation, defined as a composite of 4 reflections, with symmetry +1&#x2F;h[Ch×Ch][10] (John H. Conway), (C2h&#x2F;C1;C2h&#x2F;C1) (#1&#x27;, Patrick du Val (1964)[11]), order h.<p>In five dimensions, the symmetry of a regular 5-polytope, {p,q,r,s}, with one directed Petrie polygon marked, is represented by the composite of 5 reflections.<p>In dimensions 6 to 8 there are 3 exceptional Coxeter groups; one uniform polytope from each dimension represents the roots of the exceptional Lie groups En.

I know there are things I really wanted to do back then that my family could hav afforded to pay for, and it’s a bitter pill to swallow knowing that they refused to out of misguided principles. I didn’t really realize that until I met my wife, who was told that it was her job to go to school and get good grades, not make money. Her parents didn’t spend lavishly on her, but if she could make a reasonable case for why she should have something they’d pay for it. When she told me that, it made my own parents way of dealing with these things really sting.<p>Anyway, thought that might be interesting to you as a parent.",devops/OS,,

Another way of looking at this is that humans have shaped their “wild” environment to their advantage which is something many animals do. The trouble is in defining wild here - your point rests heavily on a definition along the lines of “shaped entirely by non-human forces” which is a circular argument. For example (and I’m no expert) but think of dam making by beavers and whether the resulting pools which expand their habitat and food are “wild”?<p>I’d agree with you that there is a qualitative difference between say industrial society and the rest of the animal world, but it’s not easy to nail down that difference in a way which doesn’t wind up excluding much of human history.",general,,

This can problematic in an anthropological angle (there are still debates among anthropologists over how some prominent ancient societies were more matriarchial than we&#x27;ve realized), but more importantly I find this belief limiting our imagination as to the various ways in how humanity can manage to have and nurture kids. Familial values aren&#x27;t only compatible with patriarchy, it can also mesh well with matriarchy (The fertility of women becoming important can also lead to women having more power over men, vice-versa). And is family the only way we can have childcare? Maybe we might have a society where everyone collectively cares each other&#x27;s kids? What would happen if we have artificial wombs, wouldn&#x27;t it significantly lower the barrier to having offspring?

However, as one takes the dark matter density higher, these rare or weak self-interactions increase in number or strength.   At densities found deep enough within galaxy clusters and within individual galaxies the self-interaction produces a phase change that <i>increases</i> the intensity of interactions with ordinary matter at distances much greater than that of the diameters of atomic nuclei (but perhaps not infinite distances, as with electromagnetism).<p>This is somewhat backwards from the neutron star studies: they start with microscopic physical mechanisms (quark deconfinement, pion condensation, and other exotica) and extract a change in bulk behaviour.    By contrast, this family of dark matter idea starts with bulk behaviour and hopes to find microscopic physical mechanisms eventually.   Which really is not very different from the standard cosmology&#x27;s cold dark matter: bulk behaviour, but we haven&#x27;t found the particles that generate it.<p>But, turning to Ken Wilson (who is extremely important in generalized phase transitions [1]): <i>density</i> of discrete elements has an obvious length scale (the mean distance between the elements) and the phase-change idea is that above a certain length scale standard cosmology&#x27;s cold dark matter is a fine effective theory; below that length scale, that effective theory needs adaptation.   In these theories there&#x27;s a singular point in the dark matter energy_density-viscosity curve, and on one side of that point the perfect fluid approximation is accurate for all practical purposes, and on the other additional parameters become <i>relevant</i>.  Or turning it around, one recovers the standard perfect fluid cold dark matter from a model with additional parameters as one takes those parameters to zero, and thus the standard perfect fluid is <i>emergent</i>.   And in turn as one studies the microscopic details of the superfluid, it is almost certain to emerge from something else, probably but not necessarily a quantum field theory.<p>- --<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nobelprize.org&#x2F;prizes&#x2F;physics&#x2F;1982&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nobelprize.org&#x2F;prizes&#x2F;physics&#x2F;1982&#x2F;press-release...</a> [quick overview of Wilson&#x27;s prize-winning work] and <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;how-quantum-field-theory-becomes-effective&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;how-qua...</a> [renormalization] and <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;25&#x2F;thanksgiving-5&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;25&#x2F;thanksgi...</a> [effective field theory more generally]",AI/Data Science,,

Nonetheless, we have a lot of studies that show how bad we are with probabilites (e.g. that the probability of two defined rare things happening at the same time is not only rare but extremely rare - unless they are interconnected of course) so there is certainly truth in here, but not quite as much as it appears at first. 
Nonetheless, I really like how much more intuitively clear the problem gets once you&#x27;re talking about 100 doors instead of 3: So if the question were: &quot;You&#x27;re taking 1 out of 100 doors, say number 27, and then the rules of the game say that the showmaster must open 98 of the other doors that all hold a goat, meaning only your door and another are remaining. In one of those is certainly the price. Will it be rather in yours or in the other? Remember that you chose randomly out of 100 doors while the shomaster had to take care not to take out the winning door when he took out the other 98 doors (unless it was already your number 27, then he could have chosen freely).

It turns out the set of probability distributions from quantum mechanics is strictly larger.<p>Fundamentally the answer is that you can&#x27;t break a Bell inequality with the socks, but you can with some entangled particles.<p>The socks analogy kinda fails to capture the interesting stuff here, and I&#x27;m not sure if any classical analogy really works, but I&#x27;m gonna try to summarise the setup.<p>You have two boxes (imagine they&#x27;re in different rooms, being operated by different people), call them A and B. Each Box allows you to input a single bit, we&#x27;ll call A&#x27;s bit x and B&#x27;s bit y. Each box outputs a single bit in response to the bit you give it, call the bit output by A a, and the bit output by B b. You can then form a probability distribution<p>P(a,b | x, y)<p>The joint probability distribution of a and b conditioned on the inputs x and y. Quantum mechanics predicts a particular form for this distribution, and in particular it does not depend where the boxes are, and when (in which order) the bits are input. Based on special relativity therefore we would expect that the distribution of a conditioned on x should be independent of the distribution of b conditioned on y. In maths this means that<p>P(a,b | x, y) = sum_i P(i) P(a|x, i) P(b|y,i)<p>Basically we&#x27;re allowing the output bits to depend on some shared randomness P(i), but we&#x27;re not allowing a to depend on y and we&#x27;re not allowing b to depend on x. This is reasonable because we have the freedom to put x in a after we receive b from y, or vice-versa, or have them separated by arbitrary amounts of space, or whatever we like.<p>It turns out that the probability distribution P(a,b|x,y) that quantum mechanics predicts is not of this form. The probability distributions we observe in reality, when we actually do the experiment are also not of this form. This seems to mean that somehow, even if they&#x27;re separated by arbitrary amounts of space, or done in whatever order you like, or whatever the output bit a does somehow depend on what input you give box B and vice-versa.",devops/OS,,

5602,"It is about how current draw is in or out of phase with voltage. Purely resistive loads won&#x27;t affect the phase of the current. However if you have reactive loads like capacitors or inductors your current draw will either have its peak before the voltage has its peak, or after. This leaves you with less power.<p>In Germany going lower than cosphi 0.9 capacitive or cosphi 0.9 inductive requires special permission from the operator of the electrical grid.<p>If your installation affects the electrical grid in negative ways they can make you pay when something breaks or switch of your power to protect the grid.<p>On top of cosphi you also have ripple (basically &quot;overtones&quot; created by non-linear loads like unfiltered switching PSUs). If your THC (total harmonic current) exceeds 5% any power transformers in your net will have significantly reduced lifetime. But German grid operators allow a maximum THC of 15%.<p>So basically there are many ways how inductive, capacitive or switching loads can &quot;deform&quot; and shift the waveforms of the currents and voltages you are drawing, some of this can have negative effects on your own devices, some of it can have negative effects on the grid. Ideally you have a cosphi of 1 (so neither inductive nor capacitive) and a THC of 0% (no harmonics of the fundamental frequency present in the sine of the current drawn), but in reality you have to stay within what your grid operator allows.",finance,,

5643,"&gt; If you want to redistribute the wealth from the holders of capital, pass laws to do so directly. Doing it in in a roundabout way via inflation is a psychological trick - you are saying, &quot;Well, laws can&#x27;t be passed to do it, so we will use this crazy constant-devaluation of everyone&#x27;s money to accomplish it&quot; and the new money doesn&#x27;t go to the people you want to help directly. Furthermore, poor people with tiny amounts of savings can&#x27;t even begin to save as their money is constantly debased. I don&#x27;t see this as an argument against deflation.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &quot;psychological trick&quot;. Nobody is tricking anyone, if <i>steady</i> and moderate inflation is the goal of a competent central bank.<p>&gt; Furthermore, poor people with tiny amounts of savings can&#x27;t even begin to save as their money is constantly debased. I don&#x27;t see this as an argument against deflation.<p>But they can take on ever-debased debt!<p>&gt; It is matters of degree to me. The US has defaulted twice in the last 100 years, first with the confiscation of gold in the 30s and later with the outright withdrawal from the gold standard in the 70s. You can argue whatever you want, but that is a de-facto default when the rules that were promised are suddenly changed at gunpoint, and now past promises are now longer valid. I see the US and other &quot;well-functioning liberal democracies&quot; as easily able to slip into being monetary basket cases, as they have been several times over history. The 1970s&#x2F;80s had absurd levels of inflation in the US which shows the situation can change rapidly. I think there is a high-risk of 10%+ inflation in the US right now.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure I&#x27;d call the US a well-functioning liberal democracy, but I&#x27;d definitely not call withdrawing from the gold standard defaulting. Besides, isn&#x27;t inflation-targeting at central banks a relatively new invention?<p>And let&#x27;s be entirely clear: if most experts saw a high risk for imminent 10%+ inflation, they would be given a very very loud microphone. Your view is a fringe one.<p>&gt; The finance sector in all western democracies is a large component of GDP - far higher than what it would be in a hard-money system IMO. Those closer to the money printer somehow get a larger share of it. Always happens.<p>Along the lines of what you wrote above: let&#x27;s pass laws to change that then.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t see why we need to artificially encourage people to spend. People should spend if they want something, not because of seizing their money if they choose not to spend. As I said before, people will always need goods and services. &quot;Hoarding&quot; money is just someone choosing to delay their gratification, which I see as a good thing.<p>That&#x27;s your personal view. Easy access to money is an important mechanism for people with actual good ideas to realize them. In a society where hoarding is &quot;artificially encouraged&quot; instead (see, both of us can play the game of inserting loaded adverbs or adjectives ;)), this mechanism stops functioning properly.<p>&gt; My point is not to say why they deflated. My point is that there was deflation, and it didn&#x27;t cause any problems. Economists act like the sky will fall if deflation occurs. It happened in computers and it was awesome.<p>Computers are not currency. I want different properties for goods and for currency. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very original desire.<p>&gt; Yes? Why should citizens-of-the-future pay for what citizens-of-the-now want? Actually paying for things would cause an honest discussion of what people are willing to pay for. If you tell people they can have everything they want for free, of course they want it. This is the weakest argument of all.<p>Are you doubting the usefulness of debt at all?<p>&gt; You act is if the rich don&#x27;t accumulate capital now. I find this argument invalid. In reality it&#x27;s the poor that can&#x27;t easily escape inflation and lose their money, while the rich are able to continue to accumulate wealth above the rate of inflation using their vast array of wealth advisors and tax lawyers. The poor are the ones without an easy way to protect their wealth in an inflationary world.<p>They do, of course. But you&#x27;re suggesting we use &quot;psychological tricks&quot; to <i>incentivize</i> this behavior!<p>I certainly share your opinion that something needs to be done about the super-wealthy.

(I&#x27;d like to introduce the XY problem of the second kind for this, where the answerer is so confident that it is the answerer who missed the actual question.)<p>Some regexes <i>can</i> recognize a language beyond the regular language. They are typically available in two flavors: recursive references (Perl, Ruby, PCRE) and stackable captures (.NET). They are obscure enough that I would not recommend them, but it is patently false that regular expressions (EDIT: of the practical interest) cannot be recursive.<p>It is possible to match individual HTML tags with regexes, but it <i>is</i> difficult. It cannot use a bare `\w` or `\s` because HTML5 parsers have peculiar definitions for tag name characters and space characters. For example your `\s` will typically match various Unicode space characters, while only ASCII whitespaces are recognized in tags. There are also several notable exceptions to the parser (and external states termed the &quot;tree construction&quot;), so missing any of them would result in an immediate XSS. If you think you can write a correct regex for HTML tags, my quizzes [1] should make you concerned. Limiting the question to XHTML does alleviate some but not all concerns.<p>The distinction between recognition and parsing is correct, but parsing doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the reconstruction of parse tree. Parsing means the access to constituent nonterminals, which can be used to reconstruct parse tree but also directly used as their own (e.g. calculators). Indeed in most regex implementations you can&#x27;t extract more than two strings out of each capture (Raku is a notable exception), so you can match against e.g. `(\w+)(?:,(\w+))*` but can&#x27;t extract a list of comma-separated words with it. Practically speaking this means you can&#x27;t extract a list of attributes with a single regex, making it unsuitable for HTML parsing anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26355451"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26355451</a>",web/mobile,,

(I&#x27;d like to introduce the XY problem of the second kind, where the answerer is so confident that it is the answerer who have missed the actual question.)<p>Some regexes <i>can</i> recognize a language beyond the regular language. They are typically available in two flavors: recursive references (Perl, Ruby, PCRE) and stackable captures (.NET). They are obscure enough that I would not recommend them, but it is patently false that regular expressions (EDIT: of the practical interest) cannot be recursive.<p>It is possible to match individual HTML tags with regexes, but it <i>is</i> difficult. It cannot use a bare `\w` or `\s` because HTML5 parsers have peculiar definitions for tag name characters and space characters. For example your `\s` will typically match various Unicode space characters, while only ASCII whitespaces are recognized in tags. There are also several notable exceptions to the parser (and external states termed the &quot;tree construction&quot;), so missing any of them would result in an immediate XSS. If you think you can write a correct regex for HTML tags, my quizzes [1] should make you concerned. Limiting the question to XHTML does alleviate some but not all concerns.<p>The distinction between recognition and parsing is correct, but parsing doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the reconstruction of parse tree. Parsing means the access to constituent nonterminals, which can be used to reconstruct parse tree but also directly used as their own (e.g. calculators). Indeed in most regex implementations you can&#x27;t extract more than two strings out of each capture (Raku is a notable exception), so you can match against e.g. `(\w+)(?:,(\w+))*` but can&#x27;t extract a list of comma-separated words with it. Practically speaking this means you can&#x27;t extract a list of attributes with a single regex, making it unsuitable for HTML parsing anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26355451"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26355451</a>",web/mobile,,

We submitted a simple patch that just introduced a kcmdline parameter to disable cpuid based calibration and fall back to msr-based method that works fine.

5951,"&gt; If it’s too easy to memorize, choose a bigger section.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work with fast passages where the pianist must feel how to use the momentum to their advantage. Better path-- choose a small enough section that may be played <i>immediately</i> at the preferred tempo.<p>&gt; Practice the section slowly enough, at first, to avoid making mistakes.<p>By playing a bite-sized segment of music at the preferred performance tempo <i>from the outset</i>, the pianist can greatly simplify the entire section in the author&#x27;s step 2 here.<p>Example of the problem:<p>1. Pianist breaks up a difficult passage in the development section of the 3rd movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Appassionata Sonata and applies a comfortable, sensible fingering.<p>2. Pianist ramps up the tempo.<p>3. Eventually, pianist hits a critical tempo where the  fingering turns out to work against the momentum of their hand.<p>4. Pianist realizes that the new momentum of the faster tempo opens up a <i>new possibility</i> for a fingering-- e.g., just throw the thumb at a new position and let the torque from the forearm land it correctly. If the rest of the arm&#x2F;shoulder stays loose that torque is a strong and reliable way to reposition the hand.<p>5. Pianist now has learned <i>two</i> fingerings that compete in their muscle memory-- one for the <i>wrong</i> tempo, which they learned first and methodically ratcheted up, and one for the <i>right</i> tempo which is newer and must be drilled more than the old fingering.<p>6. Pianist drills away at new fingering alone in a practice room.<p>7. New fingering becomes comfortable and seemingly secure.<p>8. Pianist goes plays at a different location, in front of <i>other people</i>, and that <i>wrong</i> fingering stabs at their brain like a black magic spell.<p>This is all avoided by a) practicing small segments of music at the preferred tempo b) joining them together to divide and conquer the piece.<p>Anyway, this is a common problem for a few reasons:<p>1. Pianists have a general reluctance to choose <i>very small</i> segments of music to practice.<p>2. Pianists have a propensity to choose pieces that are too difficult for their current skill level. This means they won&#x27;t come armed with general-purpose fingerings for virtuosic passages, making them likely to choose <i>wrong</i> fingerings when starting to learn virtuosic passages at slow tempos.<p>3. Music cognition is an early science. Most amateur pianists know the feeling of playing something wrong even once and then feeling how their body somehow memorizes that mistake and haunts their entire practice. But even professional pianists don&#x27;t have a shortcut for turning that experience on its head-- i.e., there&#x27;s no way to play a thing correctly <i>once</i> and have one&#x27;s body memorize that feeling as solidly as it memorizes a single mistake!",web/mobile,,

or at least give it a name that indicates clearly that this is syntactically a loop. That&#x27;s like with some iteration macros that I like to use as well from time to time. The basic idea is to never try to hide what you&#x27;re doing, since that will backfire. You can still take a balanced approach with DRY and separation of concerns principles, which can lead to reasonable macros.<p>&gt; and that&#x27;s just one example of the many thing that can go wrong because it is a macro.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to say that nothing can go wrong in above usage, or at the very least it would take criminal energy to break it (I really can&#x27;t come up with a case right now).<p>It&#x27;s perfectly doable to write safe macros with only a little experience. Follow these simple rules when defining macros: 1) parenthesize usages of macro params, and parenthesize the whole macro body if it is a complete expression. 2) Use parameters that take syntactical expressions only once, to prevent evaluating side-effects (like x++) multiple times.<p>Linux kernel even allows for variable declaration in macros by using expression statement blocks (GCC extension). Although I&#x27;ve never had a need for them, I believe that with this approach you can fulfill rule 2) in all possible situations.<p>You can improve macro safety in cases where you need to define a macro that is a little dangerous by just capitalizing the macro&#x27;s name to make clear at the call site to be a little bit careful here.

Because there are always so many other ways to break your programming, and if you&#x27;re trying to be 100% safe at the cost of being twice as hard to use, that&#x27;s effectively a net loss because you&#x27;re provoking problems in other ways.<p>&gt; On the other hand, with RIAA, you just have your file_handle that automatically close so you can&#x27;t forgot to close it, and the rules are well known and not that difficult to understand.<p>Could agree if it&#x27;s a file handle or something other off-the-shelf thing where you don&#x27;t have to make the class yourself, and everybody instinctively is aware of the implicit behaviour.

Both FreeBSD and Linux implements this VFS API with a layer called Solaris Porting Layer (SPL).<p>The original Illumos-upstream FreeBSD ZFS, this SPL layer was implemented as a kernel module (opensolaris.ko). OpenZFS originally maintain this shim in other repo, but later incorporate this shim into its codebase. FreeBSD port of OpenZFS involved importing SPL layer from FreeBSD tree into OpenZFS. On this part, there&#x27;s not much difference in nativeness of the port.<p>However, this SPL layer also serve the purpose of adding one degree of separation between GPL code and CDDL code in order to comply with GPL in order to prevent ZFS code from becoming a derivative of the Linux kernel. The shim in OpenZFS is in three licenses; the Linux part of SPL is GPLv2, the FreeBSD part is 2-BSD, and the part that interacts directly with ZFS code is CDDL.<p>This is the area where FreeBSD can be more native with regarding to ZFS. Since CDDL is compatible with BSD license, FreeBSD kernel and its userland can integrate directly with ZFS without any licensing issue, e.g., FreeBSD bootloader simply linked against ZFS, whereas GRUB2 must implement a part of ZFS in order to do probing.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD</a>",OS,,

If I take that mutated virus, and then passage it through multiple generations in lab grown hosts, it will mutate at random throughout the genome.<p>The exact rate and the time it would take is heavily debated, but one important note is that viruses with an RNA-dependant RNA polymerase are, as an evolutionary strategy, quite poor at preserving their own genetic information. They have the highest error rate of replication of any known organism. Which means, after some discrete amount of generations, you could wind up with some sort of &quot;mosaic&quot; + &quot;chimeric&quot; virus. Again though, how many generations is under hot dispute.

I personally would attribute this to a sort of gulf created by two common approaches:<p>1. It&#x27;s become very common to structure software as a stateless service cluster backed by a stateful database technology. Most of the databases used in this approach would not be described as STM, but the net effect to the application is similar, even if involving more layers and complexity.<p>2. People have gotten pretty comfortable with simple mutex patterns connected by queues of various sorts. This is a sort of worse is better situation, where the simplicity and high performance of a mutex protected whatever in a toy test or microbenchmark is far more efficient than STM. However, a system composed of many of these mutex protected islands proves a whole different beast indeed. STM has largely been criticized from the perspective of the former, vs the latter.<p>There are many people who have made the observation that transactional concurrency control, state of the art garbage collection, and even file systems have been converging on similar features. This is being driven by the common constrains on both sides of what hardware and humans expect.

683,"This is great work, but it almost makes me sad that you have to do this. I spent the earliest parts of my software career implementing full spectrum geospatial intelligence product generation algorithms for US intelligence agencies and the military. Part of the code base was software that does exactly this, but not with the historical, hand-drawn maps, but with the most current maps generated from aerial and space-borne radar sensing, as well as non-USGS data of, say, the ocean floor generated by US Navy sonar surveying programs. We could generate a map of any arbitrary coordinate boundaries of any part of the earth in seconds, using data that was at most a few years old.<p>There is absolutely no reason any of this code needs to be classified, as the maps themselves are not, the GeoTIFF format and tiling procedures are completely open standards, and the NGA has even open sourced some libraries for doing this kind of thing, but so much of the code that does this really quickly and efficiently, directly on your own workstation using C++ native executables into formats that can be rendered by a standard image viewer, is tied up in proprietary and even classified code bases just because of the monorepo nature of early work and the fact that development was done entirely on the classified systems because of the difficulty in developing on unclassified systems and then transferring across the air gap.<p>This is slowly changing, and in fact what I am presently working on is automated transfer and assurance mechanisms so more development that doesn&#x27;t need to be classified can be done on open systems and work shared, but it&#x27;s unfortunate to see so many wheels being reinvented when there are already really, really good tools to do these kinds of things but they are kept hidden.<p>We also have up-to-date indexed catalogs of exactly which tiles exist in which scale ranges to solve the problem you noted of trying to query and getting no data for poorly mapped regions. We can automatically retrieve the best data available and interpolate to the desired scale range instead. And rather than only getting the GeoTIFF, you can also get the raw altitude data intended for machine consumption, which is the main geoint use case for doing projections from sensor ephemeris to ground point.<p>I can see you also forked proj4js. This is of course also the kind of thing we had heavily optimized code for doing, since you have to project from lat&#x2F;lon to ECF in order to project from ground to coordinates in orbit, which are ECF (we had a need to do this before the open source libproj for C existed).<p>In any case, it&#x27;s unfortunate that you seemingly need to work for free doing this to get any attention and I hope you get a job out of it eventually. Sad to say I don&#x27;t think any of the big aerospace and intelligence players would give you a second look because of a basic requirement that everyone has a degree in engineering, physics, applied math, or computer science, but hopefully a more innovative, disruptive, and agile company will give you a look.

At the start either default to one version (full fat or basic), or give the user a choice up-front, and make it easy to switch later.

Applications are more likely to be web-based or services - i.e. inherently distributed - and less likely to be desktop or traditional client&#x2F;server, where almost all compute happened on a single server. As distributed services, maximizing statelessness and avoiding mutable shared memory is key to solving a lot of problems: scaling out (no shared memory), redundancy (keep a second copy of the application logic running somewhere, no sync required), recovery and idempotence (if something fails, try again until it succeeds - repeated attempts are safe).<p>Reliable persistent queues are part of that. They let you bring services up and down and switch over without down time, or restart after a failure and resume where they left off.<p>The problems of shared mutable state are best kept in specialized applications: databases, queuing systems, distributed caches, consistent key-value stores. Keeping state consistent in a distributed system is a genuinely hard problem, and STM isn&#x27;t much help, except perhaps as an implementation detail in some of those specialized applications.",devops/networking,,

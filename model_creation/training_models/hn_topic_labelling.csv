1325,"Where they get you is that it very rarely makes financial sense to do both cloud and colo&#x2F;on-prem (unless you&#x27;re a massive company).  It ends up being way more expensive to use the cloud, but also hire engineers to work on making an on-prem cloud.  Most companies have a mixed bag of projects that are either better served by the cloud, or are okay with colo and the savings it can bring.<p>Assuming you don&#x27;t want to do a hybrid approach, then you either push everyone onto the cloud and accept paying more, or you push everyone into colo and force the small and scaling out projects to deal with stuff like having to order hardware 3 months in advance.<p>Then, depending on how nice you want it to be to interact with your infrastructure, you can end up paying a lot to have people build abstractions over it.  Do you want developers to be able to create their own database from a merge request or API call?  If so, now you&#x27;re going to have to hire someone with a 6 figure salary to figure out how to do that.  It&#x27;s easy to forget how many things are involved in that.  You&#x27;re going to have a lot of databases, so you need a system to track them.  A lot of these databases are presumably not big enough to warrant a full physical server, so you have to sort out multi-tenancy.  If you have multi-tenancy, you need a way to handle RBAC so one user can&#x27;t bork all the databases on the host.  You will also need some way to handle what happens when one user is throwing so much load at the RDBMS it&#x27;s impacting other apps on that database.  To accomplish that, you&#x27;re going to need a way to gather metrics that are sharded per-database and a way to monitor those (which is admittedly one of the easier bits).  You also generally just straight up lose a lot of the scaling features.  I don&#x27;t have a way to just give you more IOPS to your database on-prem.  The best I can do is add more disks, but your database will be down for a long time if I have to put a disk in, expand the RAID, let it redistribute data and then power it back up.  That&#x27;s several hours of downtime for you, along with anyone who&#x27;s on the same database.  Of course, we can do replicas, and swap the master, but everyone will have to reconfigure their apps or we need something like Consul to handle that (which means more engineers to manage that stuff).<p>You&#x27;re also probably going to need more than one of those expensive infra people, because they presumably need an on-call rotation, and no one is going to agree to be on-call the time.  And every time someone quits, you have to train the new person, which is several months of salary basically wasted.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that you don&#x27;t need infra people on AWS, but you a) need a lot less of them, because they only need to manage the systems AWS has, not build them, and b) you can hire cheaper ops people, again because you don&#x27;t need people that are capable of building those kinds of systems.<p>Once you factor in all of that stuff, AWS&#x27; prices start looking more reasonable.  They&#x27;re still a little higher, but they&#x27;re not double the price.  If anything more than a tiny, tiny subset of the AWS features are appealing, it&#x27;s going to cost you almost as much to build your own as it does to just pay Amazon&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;whoever.<p>Also, a massive thing people overlook is that AWS is fairly well documented.  I can Google exactly how to set up permissions on an S3 bucket, or how to use an S3 bucket as a website.  It only takes seconds, the cognitive burden is low, and the low-friction doesn&#x27;t cause anyone stress.  In-house systems tend to be poorly documented, and doing anything slightly outside the norm becomes a &quot;set up a meeting with the infra team&quot; kind of thing.

All other users are secondary.<p>They do seem to be paying more attention to MacOS and Windows with GTK 4.<p>I find the notion that GTK is just for GNOME rather funny since most the GNOME apps are very basic. The Software app is notoriously crap, but that&#x27;s due to a lack of people to work on it. Their map app isn&#x27;t much more than a GTK window frame on google maps or something. The video player... I mean can&#x27;t they adopt VLC as the &quot;official&quot; media player and just make the GTK version of that really nice? VLC could use a better GUI. Same for web browser, why have a GNOME one that will never be able to keep up? Why make all these little toy apps anyway? Maybe I&#x27;m conflating gnome with a small linux distro.

OpenZFS originally maintain this shim in other repo, but later incorporate this shim into its codebase. FreeBSD port of OpenZFS involved importing SPL layer from FreeBSD tree into OpenZFS. On this part, there&#x27;s not much difference in nativeness of the port.<p>However, this SPL layer also serve the purpose of adding one degree of separation between GPL code and CDDL code in order to comply with GPL in order to prevent ZFS code from becoming a derivative of the Linux kernel. The shim in OpenZFS is in three licenses; the Linux part of SPL is GPLv2, the FreeBSD part is 2-BSD, and the part that interacts directly with ZFS code is CDDL.<p>This is the area where FreeBSD can be more native with regarding to ZFS. Since CDDL is compatible with BSD license, FreeBSD kernel and its userland can integrate directly with ZFS without any licensing issue, e.g., FreeBSD bootloader simply linked against ZFS, whereas GRUB2 must implement a part of ZFS in order to do probing.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD</a>",OS,,devops/OS

5627,"&gt;The parent said debt based economies. The US has an economy and government system that is increasingly drowning in debt (check out the corporate balance sheets in the US; nationally it&#x27;s horrific;<p>Yes, that is what happens when your currency is the world reserve currency. Every nation exports their products to you but they never want to import anything from you. Therefore you run into a domestic unemployment problem and you must take on an increasing amount of debt just to keep your economy stable. That&#x27;s the &quot;exorbitant privilege&quot; the privilege to be forced to take on debt.<p>It&#x27;s called a privilege because smart leaders recognize that you can have your cake and eat it too but neither Obama nor Trump have taken advantage of that, all they did was let the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. Trump merely wanted to reduce the disadvantages by starting a trade war with China.<p>&gt;that situation has been spurred on by the Fed&#x27;s forever low interest rates,<p>Those low interest rates aren&#x27;t spurred by government debt. They are spurred by low inflation, if possible the interest rates would be at -1% or deeper but things like treasury bonds, cash and in theory Bitcoin prevent interest rates below 0%.<p>&gt;which encourages corporations to take on ever greater sums of debt because it&#x27;s artificially cheap, which will ultimately lead to zombies ala Japan).<p>Yes, those corporations are supposed to grow their business and employ people, even if those companies are useless to society, because the beneficial effects of employment will completely outweigh the downsides of zombie companies. However, inflation never came and unemployment is taking forever to shrink. (precovid of course)<p>&gt;The Federal answer to that is to print ever increasing sums of fiat USD, because there are no foreign buyers left that can absorb tens of trillions in new US government debt.<p>There are lots of foreign buyers for USD though which drags inflation way down.<p>&gt;The Fed unavoidably becomes the primary buyer of the US Government&#x27;s debt (this is where a nation begins eating itself; that began for the US over a decade ago now as a trickle, that trickle is picking up pace).<p>This argument makes sense when the debt is fueled by Trump style tax cuts because you are ruining your ability to pay the debt back in the future, I mean, how are you supposed to pay the debt back if not by raising taxes above previous levels?<p>If you spend it on one time stimulus the risk of the debt growing only exists until the economy has recovered. If you spend the money on infrastructure you can actually net a greater return in the future.<p>&gt;Once upon a time not so long ago it was a huge deal that China held a trillion dollars of US government debt, now that sum is a joke, a mere portion of one spending program this week or next. That&#x27;s how quickly the US is imploding fiscally.<p>It&#x27;s a huge deal in the sense that it obligates the Fed to increase the money supply and the government to increase debt as mentioned in my first point. China buying US government debt IS the problem, in the sense that it forces the US government to go into more debt. If China is actively hurting the US economy, it is doing so by buying US debt which means it is not importing products from the US, which means China is not creating jobs in the USA. If China ever decides to unwind its US debt only good things will happen to the US economy.",finance,,finance

1310,"I think the idea of money as credit is very interesting (look at my HN comment history for my ramblings on the topic!).<p>&gt; I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users that could steal from you, needing to keep a node online always or trust your money to someone else who does so) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users seems like a large obstacle in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>You are right, these are disadvantages but other than &quot;trust paths&quot; the complexity can be mitigated with:<p>1. Market makers who buy IOUs at a discount and swap them for _their_ IOU which can be more trusted. Essentially you want a little bit of centralisation around parties which are known to always make good on their liabilities. These parties could be fully automated (think like Ethereum DAO) and transparent. In some ways these market makers are like banks of today but instead of lending their credit into existence, like banks do, they require people to buy it (usually) at a premium.
2. Insurance or a credit derivatives market so people can hedge against counterparts defaults.
3. If everyone agrees on a common numeraire and wallets are sophisticated to show an aggregate balance in that numeraire taking into account credit risk then that could remove much of the complexity for users. Integrated with market makers, you could &quot;auto swap&quot; IOUs to issuers which you prefer. Wallets can also provide a credit risk break down on all counterparts. Agree this is more complicated than current notions of money.
4. Securitisation markets. Package up IOUs into tranches. Traders can speculate on various levels of credit quality.
5. Sensible reputation management. Non-invasive performance tracking of debtors. Did they meet margin requirements? Did they meet all coupon payments? Etc. Can also take into account degree of co-operation with other users, for example do they accommodate restructuring and help others meet their liabilities?<p>I don&#x27;t like crypto because there&#x27;s essentially zero accountability for issuers and that kind of environment is optimal for scammers. Crypto behaves like synthetic equity&#x2F;commodity instruments with no accountable issuers. In contrast, with a credit based system, issuers are responsible for their issued liabilities and are expected to make good on them. In crypto, no-one thinks in terms of liabilities and so you get ridiculous projects like &quot;Synthentix&quot; who are collateralising a USD Stablecoins with their own issued tokens. For anyone with a basic understanding of financial risk and accounting, their approach is mad.<p>A credit based system is fairer because anyone can issue credit and the onus in on issuers to ensure they have the necessary reputation for others to accept their credit. Furthermore, credit-like instruments are natural Stablecoins - providing all agree on a numeraire, the value of credit is a function of credit risk which can be successfully managed in most cases.",finance,,finance

That is, rather than the cost of a 1990s base-model remaining the same and people just getting higher-end models, the cost of a 1990s base model increases closer to that of more feature-filled models to the point it doesn&#x27;t make sense to make the features optional.

6494,"I did mention Alexandre Dumas as a case study in a previous article. Here&#x27;s a snippet:<p>&quot;But there used to be another way. When Alexandre Dumas debuted The Count of Monte Cristo it was published as a feuilleton—a portion of the weekly newspaper devoted to fiction. From August 1844 to January 1846 his chapters were published in 18 installments for The Journal des Débats, a newspaper that went out to 9,000 to 10,000 paying subscribers in France—and readers were rapt by it.<p>In the forward to a 2004 translation of the book, the writer Luc Sante wrote: “The effect of the serials, which held vast audiences enthralled… is unlike any experience of reading we are likely to have known ourselves, maybe something like that of a particularly gripping television series. Day after day, at breakfast or at work or on the street, people talked of little else.”<p>It was basically “Game of Thrones.” Readers could not wait to get their hands on the next chapter and that bode very well for the writer who was not only paid by the newspaper in real-time for his work (by the word), but also grew the popularity of his work over the entirety of the time it was being published.<p>“The ‘Presse’ pays nearly 300 francs per day for feuilletons to Alexandre Dumas, George Sand, De Balzac, Frederic Soulé, Theophile Gautier, and Jules Sandeau,” Littell’s Little Age, Volume 10 wrote in 1846. “But what will the result be in 1848? That each of these personnages will have made from 32,000 to 64,000 francs per annum for two or three years for writing profitable trash of the color of the foulest mud in Paris?”<p>That “profitable trash” earned those writers an annual salary of between $202,107 to $404,213 in today’s dollars—and the obvious disdain of that Littell writer who, even then preferred the merits of a bound and published book. The same volume goes on to say that Dumas earned about 10,000 francs ($65,743 today) per installment when he was poached from The Presse by The Constitutionnel in 1845.&quot;<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ellegriffin.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;publishing-industry-truth"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ellegriffin.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;publishing-industry-truth</a>",AI/Data Science,,general

This is different from how the majority of cancer patients are treated today: surgery and {chemo,radio}therapy.<p>Here is a problem in our domain where tech is one of the limiting factors.<p>If you look at the DNA of any cell and compare it against the reference genome, you&#x27;ll find a lot of differences, aka variants. Typically even more so if you&#x27;re looking at a sequenced tumour (~1e6 variants). This is your hay stack. And a variant that can be medically targeted to treat the cancer is the needle. The definition of what variant is &quot;clinically relevant&quot; is layered, context-dependent, and (partially) regulated. Software is responsible for automating away the majority of variants, say down to 10-100, in a justifiable, traceable way. It&#x27;s also responsible for giving tools to the clinician to deal with the remaining ones. This manual step typically involves an informed line of questioning about each variant backed by 100s of supporting data points about it.<p>Without these two tech pieces, interpreting a single molecular pathology report can and does take many hours of (expensive) expert time, instead of minutes.

Glossy stories repel. And do you remember at least one popular film without overcoming problems and difficulties? Great tool for building trust, and relationships.
 2)Tell what has changed through experience
Creating something creates a new experience that changes us and the way we work, it&#x27;s a great thing to share.
3) Engage your readers in the process
Interactivity is a great opportunity to captivate readers.
4) Ask
Here we are not talking about questions to engage the audience, but to find expertise for your project - involve in the product, not in the tweet.
5) Shine a light on what&#x27;s behind the scene
Most of the work on the product is not visible to customers, but this does not mean that it should not be shown.
6) Story of today
Life is not always a routine, unusual events or experiments are a great opportunity to share them
7) Tell how you feel
Tell about your feelings about creating something.Creation is always a gamut of emotions.
8) Breakdown metrics&#x2F;milestone
Dry numbers are not catchy, but how you achieved this is a completely different story.
9) Uncover the value of a new feature
Do not tell what you did, tell what it will give to the user
10)Harsh truth
Moving forward, we often see and feel the hidden side.#BuildinPublic is a great opportunity to show it. Honesty wins.
11)Show your toolbox
Thor has a hammer, Captain America has a shield, but what do you have?

The decrease in emissions will be offset by a decrease in carbon capture from their food, and the net difference will be much less than assumed.<p>Moreover, if the process of creating meat replacements requires more fossil fuels to be burned than the natural process of growing food and feeding cattle, it might be that alternative meats are detrimental to the environment.

2984,"Nicholas has <i>Waded</i> (pun intended) into the waters of irrational horror over gain-of-function research that seems to <i>gain viral traction</i> following every spill-over event. The only argument presented in the article that leans towards the lab-leak hypothesis is the human-preffered double CGG codon that appears in the furin cleavage site; this is nothing like a smoking gun, IMO. Yesterday&#x27;s TWiV 751 covered a paper <i>The furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is required for transmission in ferrets</i> [1] which has the following abstract:<p>&gt; To investigate the importance of the spike polybasic CS of SARS-CoV-2 (PRRAR), a number of spike mutants predicted to modulate the efficiency of furin cleavage were generated (Fig. 1a), including: substituting two upstream arginines to produce a monobasic CS similar to SARS-CoV spike (monoCS), replacing the tribasic CS with the furin CS of a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza haemagglutinin containing seven basic amino acids (H5CS) and two naturally occurring deletions seen following passage in Vero E6 cells and&#x2F;or in clinical isolates21,26. The first deletion removes eight amino acids including all three arginines of the PRRAR site (ΔCS), while the other removes five flanking amino acids but retains the tribasic CS (Δflank). The mutations were engineered into a spike expression plasmid to enable cell surface expression and generation of coronavirus lentiviral PVs. In addition, to study the importance of the PRRAR motif in the context of live virus, we used a naturally occurring Vero-cell-adapted mutant SARS-CoV-2, ΔCS26. This variant and the wild-type (WT) virus from which it was derived were cloned by limiting dilution to enable studies using individual genotypes.<p>This is the <i>horror</i> of in vitro and in vivo viral lab research and the result is a magnificent advancement of our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the furin cleavage site, and its role in TMPRSS2 assisted membrane entry. This research follows the equally eye-opening paper covered in TWiV 715 that explained why hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) failed; Vero E6 cells lack TMPRRS2 so HCQ fully blocks entry via endocytosis. It should be noted that this study includes MERS-CoV which also has a furin cleavage site; falsifying one of the claims of Wade&#x27;s article.<p>Regardless, lab experiments begin with one or more viral isolates and molecular clock techniques should show that the original Wuhan variant has almost identical non-coding genome segments compared to existing lab isolates. The RaTG13 sequence is a very distant relative using this measure. Also, RaTG13 is not an isolate, only an RNA sample collected in wild bat anal swabs. Conflating viral isolates with RNA samples seems to be a common error; an entry in a genetic database does not imply that a viable viral line exists in a lab. A RaTG13 lab isolate would have been an important achievement to further our scientific understanding.<p>I&#x27;m confused by the dismissals of the natural origins hypothesis. The horseshoe bat roosts, that are studied, are mostly found in or near Kunming, Yunnan. This lush wild area is part of the Lancang&#x2F;Mekong River watershed&#x2F;ecosystem shared by nocturnal bats and nocturnal arboreal mammals like palm civets, pangolins, and raccoon dogs. The nearby villages contain people engaged in guano collection, the wildlife trade, and domestic livestock farming.<p>The average incubation time of COVID-19 is 4.5 days. Armed with Google maps and a basic understanding of planes, trains, and automobiles we can gauge travel time from Kunming Airport to either Wuhan Tianhe International Airport (2 hr 5 min) or Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (2 hrs). In 2003, SARS-1 emerged in Guangzhou (near Hong Kong) and the now demonized Dr. Zheng-li Shi and her team traced the origins to palm civets (the intermediate host). Why is this so hard? Why do we not ridicule the assumption that travel between major Chinese transportation hubs must leave a wake of infections along the path?<p>Finally, Wade&#x27;s article mentions a U.S. State Department claim [2]:<p>&gt; The U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.<p>If true, this is an important early super-spreader event but the remainder of the release consists of a facile analysis performed by people more knowledgeable in geopolitics than science.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-021-00908-w"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-021-00908-w</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2017-2021.state.gov&#x2F;fact-sheet-activity-at-the-wuhan-institute-of-virology&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2017-2021.state.gov&#x2F;fact-sheet-activity-at-the-wuhan...</a>",finance,,general

1544,"I’m not dumping on Ilhan Omar. I’m dumping on the mostly white people in the media who have made her, in my dad’s words, “the face of American Muslims.” She has views that are far outside the mainstream for American Muslims, particularly with respect to social issues and activism. She’s welcome to have whatever politics she wants—it’s America! But it’s wrong for the media to amplify her as if she is representative of Muslims in America as a whole.<p>This is a problem with progressives, which have disproportionate power in the media, and academia. As a group (for example Elizabeth Warren supporters) they’re as disproportionately white as the Republican Party. But they trade on the moral authority of purporting to speak for people of color. To that end, they amplify voices like Omar and Tlaib, whose politics are indistinguishable from those of secular white progressives, and not representative of Muslims. There are probably more Muslims who voted for Trump (about 1&#x2F;3) then ones who are as extreme in their politics as Omar and Tlaib. This pisses odd people like my parents, who are typical Muslim voters (moderate socially conservative Democrats).<p>It’s particularly problematic when, as the OP points out, whites people are judged differently for amplifying the voices of someone like Omar or Tlaib versus the voice of one of the many Muslims who voted for Trump. It suppresses conservatism within the community—progressive Muslims can count on getting tenure, getting in CNN, because white people are allowed to agree with and amplify them. But when conservative Muslims speak, white people are afraid to agree, and progressive whites often feel comfortable attacking them as tokens. This happens to other people of color as well—in the dozens of Asians you saw on CNN talking about the Atlanta shootings, how many were Trump voters (like 1&#x2F;3 of Asians?)",general,,general

4357,"Historically the very best software engineers outside the US simply immigrated to the US, joined a Silicon Valley company, and made a good living. The quality of those left behind, who didn’t have the same mobility, was on average lower. So companies didn’t have good reason to open an office elsewhere. This was especially true before the Internet, since collaboration was much more difficult. These days there are probably great engineers in many locations, but it takes time for their local tech economy to catch up to locations with concentrations of employers and employees like Silicon Valley. They need employers to open local offices (attracted by cheaper or better talent), and then for competing employers to also do so, in order to change the supply demand dynamics to favor software engineers. Then their salaries will rise accordingly.<p>Another part of the equation: in today’s age of massive aggregation around a few gigantic tech monopolies in the US, those few companies are able to pay large salaries because they derive a lot of value from their employees. But the reality of compensation is not very dissimilar between the US and other locations once you remove FAANG from the equation. FAANG companies employee a very highly selectively chosen segment of software developers who can command high value, but are also a tiny slice of the market. But the majority of software engineers in America are not employed in FAANG or compensated that way.",job/career,,job/career

For example I worked on an application doing calculations and rendering on the GPU in Rust (I learned almost everything for that on my own.

8913,"I wrote the terminal canvas renderers in VS Code that has been called out a few times here. Initially I implemented a canvas renderer using just a 2d context to draw many textures which sped things up &quot;5 to 45 times&quot;[1] over the older DOM renderer.<p>Since then I moved onto a WebGL renderer[2] which was mostly a personal project, it&#x27;s basically the first canvas renderer but better in every way since it works by organizing a typed array (very fast) and sending it to the GPU in one go, as opposed to piece meal and having the browser do its best to optimize&#x2F;reduce calls. This was measured to improve performance by up to 900% in some cases over the canvas renderer, but actually much more than that if for example the browser has GPU rendering disabled and tried to user the canvas renderer on the CPU.<p>My opinion here is that canvas is a great technology, capable of speeding things up significantly and getting close to native app performance. It comes with very real trade offs though:<p>- Cost of implementation and maintenance is much higher with canvas. This is particularly the case with WebGL, there have been very few contributions to xterm.js (the terminal frontend component) in the WebGL renderer because of the knowledge required.
- Accessibility needs to be implemented from scratch using a parallel DOM structure that only gets exposed to the screen reader. Supporting screen readers will probably also negate the benefits of using canvas to begin with since you need to maintain the DOM structure anyway (the Accessibility Object Model DOM API should help here).
- Plugins&#x2F;extensibility for webapps are still very possible but requires extra thinking and explicit APIs. For xterm.js we&#x27;re hoping to allow decorating cells in the terminal by giving embedders DOM elements that are managed&#x2F;positioned by the library[3].<p>More recently I built an extension for VS Code called Luna Paint[4] which is an image editor built on WebGL, taking the lessons I learned from working on the terminal canvas renderer to make a surprisingly capable image editor embedded in a VS Code webview.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;03&#x2F;terminal-renderer"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;03&#x2F;terminal-rend...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;updates&#x2F;v1_55#_webgl-renderer-is-the-new-default"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;updates&#x2F;v1_55#_webgl-renderer-...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xtermjs&#x2F;xterm.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1852"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xtermjs&#x2F;xterm.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1852</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=Tyriar.luna-paint"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=Tyriar.l...</a>",web/mobile,,web/mobile

8238,"Hi everyone! My name’s Aly, and I’m the founder of UPchieve (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upchieve.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upchieve.org</a>). I’m here with UPchieve’s CTO, Dave (thedevelopnik). We’re an edtech nonprofit that provides free, 24&#x2F;7 online tutoring to low-income high school students.<p>The idea for UPchieve was based on my own personal experience as a low-income student. I was raised by a single mom who was an immigrant to the US and often couldn’t help me with schoolwork and applying to college. So I went to a community college, and from there it took me 6 years to transfer to and graduate from a 4-year university.<p>College is not the only way for a low-income student to achieve upward mobility, but research shows it’s one of the most reliable. That was the story for me, too. Transferring to Penn helped me get a job on the trading floor at J.P. Morgan, where I immediately made 3x as much as my mom straight out of college.<p>I soon began looking for ways to give back and help other students like me get to college. Volunteering as a math tutor seemed like a great choice because I had tutored my way through HS and college and knew a lot about it, but I couldn’t find any existing volunteer opportunities that fit with my work schedule.<p>That’s when I first came up with the idea for UPchieve: an open source platform that could meet the needs of both younger-student-me (who needed help with schoolwork and college apps, often late at night in my home) and older-volunteer-me (who needed a flexible and convenient way to give back). Students can use UPchieve 24&#x2F;7 to request and get paired with a live tutor in 5 mins, and volunteers select their availability and then wait for a text notifying them that a student needs their help. You can see a demo of both the student and volunteer side of the platform here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SufRUje0XiM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SufRUje0XiM</a><p>Over the next two years, I realized that many other people cared about what I was doing and wanted to volunteer to help build the platform and tutor students. I also learned more about the state of education in the US and discovered that the gap in college completion rates between low- and high-income students hadn’t changed at all in 10+ years! This led me to grow more and more passionate about both the need for and potential of a platform like UPchieve. In 2018, I finally quit my job at J.P. Morgan to work on UPchieve full-time, with the new goal of scaling free tutoring to all low-income HS students across the US.<p>UPchieve is completely free for eligible students, and it only costs us $10 to give one student an entire year of unlimited academic support. For reference: online tutoring companies charge students $35 per hour on average. Other existing nonprofit tutoring models are prohibitively expensive and difficult to scale, due to factors like 1) cost of paid tutors, 2) in-person delivery, and 3) long-term commitments required of students and tutors.<p>We’re also working to become 100% self-sustaining (i.e., not dependent on donations). Companies like Verizon and Goldman Sachs pay us to provide virtual volunteer opportunities to their employees. Many big companies have budgets set aside specifically for volunteer opportunities because studies have found that employees who volunteer are more likely to stay at the company.<p>So far, we’ve helped more than 7,000 students and matched more than 30K on-demand requests for tutoring. My favorite part of my job has been reading the hundreds of comments we get from students each month, telling us how we’re helping them kick ass in their classes and that they can’t imagine life without us. It’s literally the best feeling ever. You can see some of my favorite student feedback here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1w3nqHSNiP-2270_Qxjvy367oRAU9Cn03gSJh7dGT5Lw&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1w3nqHSNiP-2270_Qxjvy...</a><p>If you like what we’re doing and want to help, please consider signing up to volunteer—we especially need more statistics, calculus, and physics tutors!

8142,"I&#x27;m not talking about fair share of the profits - the OSS project, I hope, has no profits.<p>Babel, in particular, is a project that&#x27;s primarily interesting to software development companies. It&#x27;s not consumer-facing software like Signal or Firefox or GNOME or whatever. It&#x27;s not the logic for a self-driving car or a pacemaker. It&#x27;s a tool that&#x27;s for software developers who want to write in one version of JavaScript and have code run in an environment that expects another version of JavaScript.<p>I would agree with you for things like Signal or Firefox - that while there&#x27;s theoretically a monetary value for me being able to use them, it&#x27;s difficult and weird to pin down that number, and it&#x27;s a social good to have them available for free.<p>But there&#x27;s a very non-theoretical monetary value for companies that use Babel. They can develop software x% faster, and they pay $y per unit time to develop software, so the value is x times y. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if the company using Babel makes any profit: their costs are lower because they use it.<p>And, corresponding, Babel isn&#x27;t a social good like Signal or Firefox. It doesn&#x27;t make the world a better place on its own. It makes the world a better place insofar as people using Babel are trying to make the world a better place and they can do so faster. (Or it makes the world a worse place if people using Babel are trying to make the world a worse place.)<p>So it&#x27;s up to the people using Babel, all of whom have significant engineering funding, to make sure it continues to exist and work. And they should be doing so on a scale commensurate with the cost savings they get from Babel. Which is to say, they <i>will</i> do so, provided that the danger of Babel not existing is real, and the possibility of avoiding that fate with funding is real - it&#x27;s in their rational self-interest to do so.<p>Or, in other words, the framing of &quot;funding sufficient to keep a project alive&quot; as &quot;fair share of the profits,&quot; and the idea that closed-source software companies can reasonably expect &quot;profits&quot; and open-source projects used by those companies cannot, is itself the crisis. We have no way of talking about funding apart from profit. Either we need to come up with one, or we need to admit that the only way to solve the open-source funding crisis is giving up on open source.<p>If we can&#x27;t figure out how to employ more than one person on Babel when its users&#x27; rational self-interest would be to fund it to the tune of many millions of dollars a year if they had to, is it any surprise Signal is pivoting to cryptocurrencies and Firefox is pivoting to VPNs?",web/mobile,,web/mobile

Especially, since Tantivy architecture is based on Lucene&#x27;s. And - AFAIK - Lucene&#x27;s index segments are read-only, by its core design. And a lot of &quot;clever index optimizations&quot; Elasticsearch article talks about is actually at the Lucene&#x27;s level. And Lucene is very modular with different implementation for DirectoryReader, Posting formats, etc.<p>Similarly, shard management and request routing is in SolrCloud. Position encoding are in core Lucene. NLP is done by OpenNLP in Solr. The Parts-Of-Speech information can be added to tokens with Payloads.<p>So, it would be interesting to hear the comparison starting from that point.<p>Finally, Lucene comes with the benchmarking module. I saw you mention &quot;twice as fast&quot; in another reply, something that compares apples to apples would be interesting.

And yet, even in the midst of this crisis, COBOL systems didn’t actually break down. Although New Jersey’s governor issued his desperate plea for COBOL programmers, later investigations revealed that it was the website through which people filed claims, written in the comparatively much newer programming language Java, that was responsible for the errors, breakdowns, and slowdowns. The backend system that processed those claims—the one written in COBOL—hadn’t been to blame at all.<p>One can bet good money on the expectation that the mainframes will be the last component of a system to crash and burn.

With the important difference that, if the compiler could prove that the callee (or anything it calls, passing the variable, transitively) wasn&#x27;t going to do anything write-like with the data behind the pointer, then the copy in the function prologue could be optimized out.<p>This compiler optimization can only occur if the copy is the callee&#x27;s responsibility. Given external linkage (think: separate compilation units, e.g. calling a function defined in a static library that&#x27;s already compiled and only available in binary form), the caller can&#x27;t guarantee the properties of the callee. But a callee can always guarantee <i>its own</i> properties during function-prologue&#x2F;epilogue generation—since it&#x27;s generating the function prologue&#x2F;epilogue in the very same compiler session that has access to the AST that describes the function&#x27;s static-analysis-proven properties in full.<p>(Yes, this means that a compiler could <i>be mistaken about</i> whether a callee writes through the implicit pointer underneath the passed value, and therefore generate the optimized function prologue when it shouldn&#x27;t. This is known as <i>a compiler bug</i>, and wouldn&#x27;t be something J Random Hacker would ever run into if using a stable, non-alpha release of their compiler, with a stable, non-alpha release of support for this calling convention.)<p>&gt; What cleanliness?<p>The functionality being proposed is that you just pass-by-value (which makes obvious that the semantics your code is enacting is &quot;the function can do whatever it likes with the value, and it won&#x27;t affect the caller, because <i>if it writes</i>, it&#x27;s writing <i>to a copy</i> of the value&quot;); but sometimes it&#x27;ll be automagically faster than it could have otherwise been, because sometimes, when the compiler can prove certain properties, no copy — only an indirect memory read — would be occurring.<p>This allows you to <i>always use pass-by-value</i> when you want those semantics, and to get code that&#x27;s &quot;as optimal as it can be&quot;; rather than having to pass pointers around and explicitly copy-on-write and all that mess in order to get that same level of optimization.<p>(And yes, that&#x27;s the alternative in heavily performance-oriented code like a database&#x27;s tuple materialization logic. You don&#x27;t get to write clean code at the expense of performance. Your &quot;options&quot; are to write performant code using dirty hacks; or fix the conventions you&#x27;re coding on top of so that performant code doesn&#x27;t <i>require</i> dirty hacks.)",web/mobile,,web/mobile

100,"My biggest problem using Nix has been minor changes, like the address of upstream sources, rippling down through dependencies. Hopefully this will improve with content addressing, and make it easier to fetching from places like IPFS. As an example:<p>- I wrote a piece of software as part of a research project, which I kept in git and built using Nix.<p>- That tool was generally useful, so I didn&#x27;t want to pollute its repo with my particular experiment scripts&#x2F;results, etc. so I kept those in a separate repo which pinned a particular commit of that tool.<p>- The writeups&#x2F;papers based on these experiments had a lot of churn (as usual), so I kept those in a third git repo, which pinned a particular commit of the experimental results. These writeups did some analysis, generated graphs, etc. which was also managed by Nix.<p>This all worked great, everything was reproducible, identified by unforgable git commit IDs, etc. Then Microsoft bought GitHub and a bunch of people&#x2F;projects deleted their repos (e.g. moving to GitLab, or wherever). That broke the tool&#x27;s build, making the whole chain from tool -&gt; experiment -&gt; paper unreproducible. It was easy enough to fix by swapping the URLs in the .nix files, but that changed the git commit ID; hence the existing experimental data was tied to a commit which didn&#x27;t work.<p>Content-addressing would:<p>- Allow monkey-patching a fix, by letting me declare that both commits produce the same tool (despite their sources containing slightly different .nix files), and hence this change doesn&#x27;t alter the experimental results.<p>- Allow such issues to be prevented, by making it easier to fetch dependencies from content-addressed storage like IPFS, which reduces the reliance on third-party servers keeping URLs alive; e.g. I could keep hosting the desired sources myself.

1314,"I think the idea of money as credit is very interesting (look at my HN comment history for my ramblings on the topic!).<p>&gt; I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users that could steal from you, needing to keep a node online always or trust your money to someone else who does so) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users seems like a large obstacle in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>You are right, these are disadvantages but other than &quot;trust paths&quot; the complexity can be mitigated with:<p>1. Market makers who buy IOUs at a discount and swap them for _their_ IOU which can be more trusted. Essentially you want a little bit of centralisation around parties which are known to always make good on their liabilities. These parties could be fully automated (think like Ethereum DAO) and transparent. In some ways these market makers are like banks of today but instead of lending their credit into existence, like banks do, they require people to buy it (usually) at a premium.<p>2. Insurance or a credit derivatives market so people can hedge against counterparts defaults.<p>3. If everyone agrees on a common numeraire and wallets are sophisticated to show an aggregate balance in that numeraire taking into account credit risk then that could remove much of the complexity for users. Integrated with market makers, you could &quot;auto swap&quot; IOUs to issuers which you prefer. Wallets can also provide a credit risk break down on all counterparts. Agree this is more complicated than current notions of money.<p>4. Securitisation markets. Package up IOUs into tranches. Traders can speculate on various levels of credit quality.<p>5. Sensible reputation management. Non-invasive performance tracking of debtors. Did they meet margin requirements? Did they meet all coupon payments? Etc. Can also take into account degree of co-operation with other users, for example do they accommodate restructuring and help others meet their liabilities?<p>I don&#x27;t like crypto because there&#x27;s essentially zero accountability for issuers and that kind of environment is optimal for scammers. Crypto behaves like synthetic equity&#x2F;commodity instruments with no accountable issuers. In contrast, with a credit based system, issuers are responsible for their issued liabilities and are expected to make good on them. In crypto, no-one thinks in terms of liabilities and so you get ridiculous projects like &quot;Synthentix&quot; who are collateralising a USD Stablecoins with their own issued tokens. For anyone with a basic understanding of financial risk and accounting, their approach is mad.<p>A credit based system is fairer because anyone can issue credit and the onus in on issuers to ensure they have the necessary reputation for others to accept their credit. Furthermore, credit-like instruments are natural Stablecoins - providing all agree on a numeraire, the value of credit is a function of credit risk which can be successfully managed in most cases.",finance,,

The extermination of Jews was not a byproduct, it was one of the key goals.<p>For further detail, I encourage the interested reader to check out &quot;The War Against the Jews&quot; by Lucy Davidowitz.",general,,

I mean projects and not developers because projects tend to hire like developers and then developers mostly share same problematic quality.  In the end it is not individual contributors who are at fault but management who allowed it to happen.<p>#1. Insufficient programming skills. This where developers don&#x27;t use libraries because they don&#x27;t even know they exist, can&#x27;t recognize the problem they are solving as generic. This is where they can&#x27;t structure the code because they haven&#x27;t seen much code at all and&#x2F;or are not interested in learning.<p>You can recognize this immediately as codebases with a lot of code duplication and very weak structure&#x2F;abstractions.<p>#2. Too much programming ambition. This is where developers think so highly of themselves that they can&#x27;t accept existing off the shelf components and will reinvent them because they can do better. They will write new everything because it will offer 10% performance increase in their specific case or just for the intelectual fun of doing it. They will obsess over ensuring there is no duplication of code at the cost of creating baroque structures that have no meaning and purpose other than ensure that every single component works in every single case supported by the application and in any possible future.<p>You can recognize this as codebases with no duplication but when you try to read the code it seems the structure is so complicated you need to have a huge map on entire wall and a guide to be able to travel the codebase. Most of the objects don&#x27;t have any meaning in the domain of the problem and are just abstract &quot;stuff&quot; necessary to glue everything together.<p>I very much prefer working with case #1<p>The reason is that, as dumb as the code is, you can read it and understand what the author <i>probably</i> had in mind, what the application attempts to do. You can then work with the code, refactor functionality out, and so on.<p>In my experience case #2 is usually beyond repair (or at least beyond my abilities to repair). These developers become easily hostile -- because they think very highly of themselves they treat everybody as inferior and now I am trying to write some dumb unsophisticated code and so I must be dumb. They also tend to change jobs pretty easily so the only result of trying to fix that kind of project is people suddenly leaving it and management getting restless at the lack of progress.<p>And for some reason every single C++ team I worked with falls under case #2.<p>I think because, given so many options, you need to have ambition to willingly choose C++ as your main programming language and so the population is preselected.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are all highly intelligent people.

1981,"Sure, it&#x27;s more an observation of the mechanics underpinning cryptocurrencies. My statement was actually incorrect in that there are not actually &quot;issuers&quot; per se in crypto and that can be a problem.<p>Cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH and whatever else are not &quot;money&quot; in the sense that we generally understand. This money is either a credit on a commercial bank or a credit on a central bank. These entities are responsible for managing the liquidity and solvency of their balance sheet such that the credit you hold retains value (Yes, I know there is inflation but that&#x27;s an orthogonal concern, I would argue). There is a governance and legal framework underpinning how money works in this &quot;mundane World&quot;. Everything in the mundane world is a legal agreement. Financial agreements are always someone&#x27;s liability and that&#x27;s a good thing because someone is always accountable if something goes wrong.<p>Cryptocurrency behaves more like some kind of synthetic commodity. By that I mean that it inherently has no value and has no use for anything other than being a &quot;token&quot;. When cryptocurrency is created, it has no issuer. There&#x27;s no accepted legal framework or explicit governance framework for holding people accountable if something goes wrong (other than code is law) and things go wrong all the time. There are rug pulls, exchange rate crashes and project failures are ten a penny etc... and this is all happening while the crypto world is in a mega bull market! What happens when the next bear market comes around? All the projects that _seem_ viable now will suddenly become unviable. All the debt positions collateralised with sketchy crypto will unwind en masse. I suspect the tokens for many projects out there will trade close to zero. People who invested in various projects from algo stablecoins to lending protocols will suddenly find that they hold worthless tokens with zero recourse. By this point the insiders would have exited into BTC&#x2F;ETH&#x2F;fiat ready to start the next round of &quot;projects&quot;.<p>Maybe this is OK. I mean, it is what it is and clearly some people are fine with that. I think we can do better though. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m interested in credit based monetary systems because reputation is a key part, so participants are accountable for their actions. This is fundamental for any significant real world adoption. Furthermore, credit based instruments do have intrinsic value which is a function of issuer credit risk. Such instruments are more stable than &quot;synthetic commodities&quot; and have more utility for real world uses.<p>Having said all that. I work in the crypto world and quite enjoy it. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as some would have you believe.",finance,,

2014,"Below the surface level question of &quot;did it escape a lab&quot; is the question of why that matters to people. Both escaping a lab and evolving naturally in the wild are in essence freak accidents. A roll of the cosmic dice. A bristling array of implausibilities. What difference does it make that we got unlucky in this way as opposed to that way?<p>Would the logical conclusion from the &quot;escaped a lab&quot; theory be that China shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have virology research? Should any nation? Who gets to decide? Exactly what actionable conclusion depends on knowing if the origin of the virus was a lab or not?<p>There are maybe one in a dozen proponents of the lab theory that are legitimately interested in these questions. For the remaining 11 out of 12, the Wuhan Lab theory is just a belief that they wear in public to signal &quot;China bad&quot;. An alarming number of people think China created the virus and released it on purpose. I once heard someone say China released the virus just to prove that our healthcare system is bad. Let me highlight the absurdity here. This person believes China engineered a virus and then released it on their own people in a city most foreigners were unaware of so that it would eventually make it to the US. They did all this just to prove some politically left point about socialized healthcare. That&#x27;s not a real belief about how the world works. That&#x27;s thinly veiled &quot;I hate liberals and China&quot;.<p>Most of these people are trying to reach a conclusion that the world should punish China with sanctions or (in extreme cases) war.

2344,"&gt; There&#x27;s no integrating them with auto traffic whether or not you force them into the same roadway.<p>Roads can accommodate traffic moving at different speeds.  For example, buses and trucks consistently move slower than passenger vehicles, especially up grades, but drivers of faster vehicles simply change lanes to pass them.  This works on interstates where drivers of passenger vehicles are going 70 to 90 mph and commercial vehicles are going 40 to 60 mph.<p>Similarly, on a surface street with traffic moving anywhere from 0 to 40 mph, cyclists moving 0 to 20 mph can similarly integrate with traffic with faster drivers changing lanes to pass them.<p>&gt; Part of good separate path design is planning the intersections to prevent the sort of crashes you&#x27;re describing.<p>I&#x27;ve read about the designs, but the assumptions that they make do not really hold.  For example, the typical &quot;protected&quot; intersection with curb extensions and an offset assumes that a motorist will look down the bike path to check for cyclists before exiting an intersection while moving at 10 mph.  In reality, drivers aren&#x27;t going to do that.<p>As I noted earlier, this principle works with pedestrians, because, while walking, they&#x27;re moving around 5 feet per second, so seeing a pedestrian 10 feet away from the intersection is pretty easy for a driver making a turn since they really don&#x27;t have to look down the sidewalk.<p>In contrast, a cyclist is moving anywhere from 15 to 30 feet per second.  A cyclist that&#x27;s two seconds away from entering an intersection can be anywhere from 30 to 60 feet away.  This requires a drivers to actually look down the bike path, which isn&#x27;t always going to occur.  The cyclist may assume that the turning driver has seen them, but that assumption is in correct, and the cyclist will have to slow rapidly to avoid a collision.<p>Also, a lot of cyclists, when making use of such infrastructure, believe that they have pedestrian style right of way, meaning that they will do things like ride around the front of a turning vehicle believing that they&#x27;ll stop to avoid a collision instead of just yielding.<p>A typical person takes about a second or so to react to something unexpected.  At 10 mph, the motorist has already covered 16 feet, meaning that they would collide with a cyclist before they have a chance to even press the brake pedal.",general,,

They can rely on western scientists to debunk the lab created hypothesis.  That leaves their own theories about it originated in Italy as the standing theory for their own domestic consumption.

2659,"I started getting Migraine headaches in the late spring at age 17 and continued to get them in the spring&#x2F;fall weekly for about two decades[0].  I remember the age and the season because, up to that point, I had headaches.  What happened that day resulted in a trip to the emergency room, on my insistence; I thought my brain was bleeding[1].  After 4 hours, I was sent home with a note to take two extra strength Tylenol.  And for the 20 years that followed, that was about the quality of treatment I received.<p>Everything, for me, is solved with a medication that is very rarely prescribed for Migraine.  My issue is that I cannot take the usual medications (imitrex, etc).  They are effective, but I lack a gene that is required to flush them from my system correctly and had this effect where 30 minutes after taking the pill I&#x27;d be the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been in my entire life, and about 1.5 hours later, I&#x27;d be miserable ... <i>comical-if-they-weren&#x27;t-happening-to-you</i> mood swings, which almost killed me[2].<p>The thing of it is, I&#x27;ve seen several doctors for this.  After a mess of semi-unrelated circumstances around that event which almost killed me, I ended up on a prescription for Depokote.  It&#x27;s a very old medication, originally prescribed for seizures and I now commonly used off-label for bipolar.  It was prescribed to me with the endorsement of &quot;a few of my patients responded well to this, none of them had side effects, and this is where we&#x27;re at on the list of choices&quot; ... basically, the guy had no confidence it would work, so I didn&#x27;t either.  It was prescribed mid-summer, and I noticed after about a week that I felt like I was carrying around <i>zero</i> anxiety[3], and a number of other fantastic side-effects[4].<p>The whole time, regardless of specialist, there wasn&#x27;t anyone who could give me a really good idea of just what the hell was really going on in my skull.  I&#x27;ll admit, after reading this, I&#x27;m wondering if I really have Migraine or if I don&#x27;t have some other thing (cluster was ruled out).  My triggers are seasonal; and I have bad days when there has been a large shift from high-&gt;low or low-&gt; high.  Interestingly, though, if I get a migraine, I am pretty much insulated from getting another one for about a week, which implies some sort of biological process that is serving some function, since multiple repeats of that trigger, or even much stronger ones, will not cause a second migraine for several days after one already landed.<p>[0] Varying lengths but until I learned to cope with the symptoms, it at least destroyed the entire rest of the remaining day once it hit.  Often remained a day after, as well.<p>[1] I really, <i>really</i>, hated hospitals as a kid.  My parents took me on my insistence because they knew I would only demand to go if I seriously thought I was dying ... even though it was a headache.<p>[2] A combination of medications related to Migraine which I took during an attack (as prescribed) resulted in my serotonin levels sending me to the hospital. It. Was. Bad.<p>[3] I never thought of myself as anxious, and it&#x27;s never been an issue in my life -- that I know of -- that has held me back.  But, holy cow, the difference was <i>stark</i>.<p>[4] For medications with &quot;brain affecting&quot; side-effects, I <i>do not</i> read the label.  My wife takes that responsibility.

2710,"I started getting Migraine headaches in the late spring at age 17 and continued to get them in the spring&#x2F;fall weekly for about two decades[0].  I remember the age and the season because, up to that point, I had headaches.  What happened that day resulted in a trip to the emergency room, on my insistence; I thought my brain was bleeding[1].  After 4 hours, I was sent home with a note to take two extra strength Tylenol.  And for the 20 years that followed, that was about the quality of treatment I received.<p>Everything, for me, is solved with a medication that is very rarely prescribed for Migraine.  My issue is that I cannot take the usual medications (imitrex, etc).  They are effective, but I lack a gene that is required to flush them from my system correctly.  So 30 minutes after taking the pill I&#x27;d be the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been in my entire life, and about 1.5 hours later, I&#x27;d be miserable.  It was <i>comical-if-they-weren&#x27;t-happening-to-you</i> mood swings, which almost killed me[2].<p>I&#x27;ve seen several doctors for this.  After a mess of semi-unrelated circumstances around that event which almost killed me, I ended up on a prescription for Depokote.  It&#x27;s a very old medication, originally prescribed for seizures and I now commonly used off-label for bipolar.  It was prescribed to me with the endorsement of &quot;a few of my patients responded well to this, none of them had side effects, and this is where we&#x27;re at on the list of choices&quot; ... basically, the guy had no confidence it would work, so I didn&#x27;t either.  It was prescribed mid-summer, and I noticed after about a week that I felt like I was carrying around <i>zero</i> anxiety[3], and a number of other fantastic side-effects[4].  By the end of the following spring, I was convinced it worked -- completely.  It was the first year I had gone any season without a single Migraine headache.  Interestingly, I&#x27;d get the &quot;aura&quot;, on occasion, but it would never melt into horrifying pain.<p>The whole time, regardless of specialist, there wasn&#x27;t anyone who could give me a really good idea of just what the hell was really going on in my skull.  I&#x27;ll admit, after reading this, I&#x27;m wondering if I really have Migraine or if I don&#x27;t have some other thing (cluster was ruled out).  My triggers are seasonal; and I have bad days when there has been a large shift from high-&gt;low or low-&gt; high.  Interestingly, though, if I get a migraine, I am pretty much insulated from getting another one for about a week, which implies some sort of biological process that is serving some function, since multiple repeats of that trigger, or even much stronger ones, will not cause a second migraine for several days after one already landed.<p>[0] Varying lengths but until I learned to cope with the symptoms, it at least destroyed the entire rest of the remaining day once it hit.  Often remained a day after, as well.<p>[1] I really, <i>really</i>, hated hospitals as a kid.  My parents took me on my insistence because they knew I would only demand to go if I seriously thought I was dying ... even though it was a headache.<p>[2] A combination of medications related to Migraine which I took during an attack (as prescribed) resulted in my serotonin levels sending me to the hospital. It. Was. Bad.<p>[3] I never thought of myself as anxious, and it&#x27;s never been an issue in my life -- that I know of -- that has held me back.  But, holy cow, the difference was <i>stark</i>.<p>[4] For medications with &quot;brain affecting&quot; side-effects, I <i>do not</i> read the label.  My wife takes that responsibility.  My thinking is: (1) placebo&#x2F;nocebo effect is really strong when the thing it effects is emotional&#x2F;personality.

For SARS-CoV-2, after about the same time and a much more intensive effort, we&#x27;re still waiting.<p>Lab-accident origin is easy to trace only if the people working in the lab disclose everything they were working with. This requires both perfect honesty and perfect knowledge. The WIV did lots of work sampling viruses from nature, in remote bat caves that very few other humans would ever enter--around Yunnan to be clear, about 900 miles from Wuhan--and they could have leaked a novel virus before they even had a chance to sequence it.

2845,"Unfortunately, I do not remember right now some good titles, but there are various books about comparative linguistics, which analyze the similarities and differences between languages and the various existing ways of expressing the same content.<p>Most ancient languages, including most ancient Indo-European languages, like Latin or Ancient Greek, allowed a free order of the words, because there were markers for each syntactic role, like agent, patient, instrument, beneficiary and so on (i.e. the so-called cases).<p>Nevertheless, at the stage where the old Indo-European languages became attested in writing, they had a very serious defect. Even if the so-called case terminations of the words were originally a small set of post-positions corresponding to the syntactic roles, due to various phonetic evolutions conditioned by the adjacent sounds present in words, the original small set of markers had diverged into a very large set of word terminations with many distinct variants for each syntactic role, the so-called word declensions.<p>Because remembering such a large set of word terminations became too difficult, most modern European languages have abandoned the old declensions. Some languages use enough prepositions, possibly together with some remnants of the old case terminations, to allow a free order of the words.<p>English however, depends a lot on the standard order of the words to convey their syntactic roles and it has only limited means of expression for supporting a different word order.<p>While in the Indo-European languages the too irregular word declensions could not persist, there are other language families with a much more regular structure for the syntactic role markers, while still having enough markers to allow a free word order.<p>It is weird that the European linguists of the previous centuries considered the regular languages (the so-called agglutinative languages or isolant languages) as &quot;primitive&quot; while considering the &quot;flexionar&quot; classic Indo-European languages as &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot;.<p>In fact even if the flexionar classic Indo-European languages evolved from some older agglutinative language, their irregular declensions were a serious defect and not a sign of progress.<p>Unfortunately, because the language changes have always been done mostly by the less educated people, without having any kind of grand plan of how to best improve the language, the necessary simplifications of the language have also been frequently accompanied by a loss of expressiveness, like in English.",web/mobile,,

A lot of it has to do with Linux being a hodgepodge of different contributors resulting in every feature effectively being a 3rd party feature.

I spent the vast majority of the game thinking X, Y, and Z scenes were really dumb until their context was finally revealed.<p>I can appreciate that type of storytelling.  It&#x27;s different and more complex than I guess most &quot;Western&quot; writing.  But it&#x27;s hard to escape the taint it puts on most of my time with the game.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m not writing this to convince you personally to rethink your experience with the game.  Like I said, if the story doesn&#x27;t work for someone, Automata is an awful game.

Those hacks were the state of the art for all Windows screen readers from the late 90s through the mid to late 2000s; I did similar hacks myself.

These days, web browsers implement documented accessibility APIs (there are still a couple of competing APIs on Windows), and screen readers consume them. Of course, between the web application, the browser, and the screen reader, there&#x27;s still room for misinterpretation of the standards, but the situation is better than it was back then.<p>As for Linux, I dislike the Orca screen reader simply as a user.

Whether the companies that became dominant were founded by younger or older people is irrelevant to the argument.<p>The main point I took away from this article is that the younger people today, Millenials if you will, are not used to an open internet, so they see the internet as a closed gate community, a divisive force. A completely different view of the Internet than the previous generation had. And as the younger people are the ones with the most energy to fight against what they perceive as injustices, they tend to actually dominate policy making even if indirectly, and what they see as the enemy is things like encryption and even privacy, which the previous generation saw as essential for a free Internet.<p>I agree completely with that, but I am not optimistic as the author is that GenXers will at some point get their act together and make the internet more open again. I believe what will happen is that the Internet will continue being this divisive force until legislation (pushed by younger people who don&#x27;t know better) is introduced to curtail freedom of expression and remove all privacy in the name of justice.

I was also interested in math, and I ended up taking three courses from him: an introduction to mathematical logic, with about twenty students; a seminar on set theory and the foundations of arithmetic, with four or five students; and a one-on-one tutorial on point-set topology.<p>For the latter two courses, he taught based on his “do mathematics” principle. He would provide us with definitions of basic concepts and then have us work through a series of not-so-difficult problems that led eventually to proofs of the major theorems. He let us do most of the work ourselves, though if we got stuck he would provide pointers to help us keep moving ahead. His method was inspired by that of Robert Lee Moore [1], though Halmos was not as hard-assed about it as Moore reportedly was [2].

Celestial objects were described as moving in circles, because perfect circular motion was considered an innate property of objects that existed in the uncorrupted realm of the celestial spheres. The theory of impetus, the ancestor to the concepts of inertia and momentum, was developed along similar lines by medieval philosophers such as John Philoponus and Jean Buridan. Motions below the lunar sphere were seen as imperfect, and thus could not be expected to exhibit consistent motion. More idealized motion in the &quot;sublunary&quot; realm could only be achieved through artifice, and prior to the 17th century, many did not view artificial experiments as a valid means of learning about the natural world. Physical explanations in the sublunary realm revolved around tendencies. Stones contained the element earth, and earthly objects tended to move in a straight line toward the centre of the earth (and the universe in the Aristotelian geocentric view) unless otherwise prevented from doing so.[25]<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_physics#Medieval_Europe"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_physics#Medieval_Eu...</a><p>That was what the best of humanity could come up with over 2 millennia.

Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:

3540,"It&#x27;s got a lot of feng shui for simple computer architectures.<p>For one thing, you can have your code, static memory, and then heap at the beginning of the address space, and the stack at the end of the address space, and not have to worry about explicitly sizing the stack. On some architectures you could even just zero-initialize the stack pointer, and it will roll over to the end of memory on the first push.<p>You can also use the same machine code instructions that make array indexing efficient to access variables on the stack (load&#x2F;store with literal offset,) without having to support signed offsets which would have effectively wasted a precious bit in a very common opcode.<p>When you overrun a buffer, it is more likely to cause your program to crash by corrupting the stack. This is bad in modern times for obvious security reasons, but pragmatically it would have been a useful &quot;feature&quot; in the early days of programming.<p>It pairs nicely with the semantics of a semaphore, where you decrement to acquire and increment to release.<p>The stack pointer conceptually points to valid memory, rather than pointing to invalid memory adjacent to valid memory. This likely has some favorable traits when it comes to how an architecture implements function calls. For example, RET could load the value at the stack pointer into the program counter, then increment the stack pointer. Loading from memory often takes multiple cycles compared to incrementing a register, and this starts the load a cycle earlier than otherwise for the same amount of combinatorial logic.",web/mobile,,

And in a lot of places, user experience is outright horrible because of the restrictions. Have you ever tried to move music from files to the music app? You can&#x27;t. So I have music on my iPhone I basically cannot play. Same for videos. And a lot of data handling is awkward at least. With all their power through the App Store, Apple should insist that all apps which have some sort of local data also support the files app. That all apps which play video properly support picture in picture (most don&#x27;t or differently). Not to mention, that there isn&#x27;t even the most basic, even if completely sandboxed, shell application.

3607,"&gt; This is largely a myth, please provide an namespace-related CVE that has gone unpatched to support your argument.<p>What I mean is that if you use LXC namespace&#x27;s as a container it is going to be an insecure container. Simply because LXC namespace&#x27;s are not containers and are not going to provide a fully isolated environment. Namespace&#x27;s are low-level building blocks which, together with other technologies (for example a virtualized network stack), you can use to make fully isolated containers. And that&#x27;s why most hosters just took a shortcut and put the whole thing in a hardware VM to ensure tenants are fully isolated. Which I think is a shame since you also get all the overhead of a hardware VM.<p>So sure, you can _make_ something like jails or zones on Linux if you combine a bunch of things and provide the glue. But there is no concept of a container like jails or zones in Linux. Which leads to other problems such as there not being any tooling to mange the (non-existant) container.<p>&gt;  The reason they run as VMs is that hypervisors run on ring 0 and require higher privileges than the kernel, therefore they are naturally more secure.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I fully understand what your saying here but I think you mean that with a type 2 hypervisor the hypervisors kernel runs in a more privileged mode on the CPU then the virtualized kernels it manages and that provides additional security?<p>I don&#x27;t really see how a type 2 hypervisor would conceptually give additional security in regards to a type 1 hypervisor (where a single kernel can provide multiple OS instances such a FreeBSD with Jails or Solaris &#x2F; Illumos with Zones). Everything that is not the &quot;main&quot; kernel always executes in a less privileged mode then the kernel executing them on the CPU.

4109,"I was once going to write 20,000 words or so on this question, but haven&#x27;t gotten to it yet.<p>Crawl is much newer, much more actively developed, much more prone to radically change from version to version, much less based on learning details through experience, much more helpful to the player in the UI (both in terms of features like autoexplore, autofight, autotravel, and item search, and in terms of proactively prompting you to avoid accidentally doing wasteful or pointless actions).<p>NetHack is older, funnier, prioritizes and facilitates obscure knowledge on the player&#x27;s part more (e.g., complicated techniques for identifying items that require memorization), has more complicated interactions between and among items, players, and the environment (e.g. many more distinct ways to use a given item), and is crueler both in terms of unavoidable deaths (&quot;The spikes were poisoned. The poison was deadly.&quot;) and in terms of allowing the player to take actions that foreseeablely result in waste or instant death.<p>Crawl has more replay value in terms of different ways to win [i.e., not having a standardized set of items that you need to collect and use], and even different definitions of what counts as winning [i.e., you can choose to collect anywhere from 3 to 15 runes]. Both games have conduct challenges of various kinds to make the game even harder.<p>In NetHack, unidentified scrolls are somewhat more dangerous than unidentified potions; in Crawl, unidentified potions are uniformly more dangerous than unidentified scrolls. :-)<p>In NetHack, obscure game knowledge that you acquired twenty years ago is still extremely valuable. In Crawl, it is probably already long obsolete and likely refers to monsters, items, or dungeon branches that no longer even exist in the modern game.<p>The two games famously differ in their approach to spoilers. In NetHack, the game almost never reveals any quantitative or concretely practical information about the purpose or effect of something, and even things like weapon hit percentages and relative efficacy traditionally are considered spoilers. In Crawl, the online help system will, in recent versions, even reveal your current exact hit probability against a particular enemy and the enemy&#x27;s hit probability against you, as well as what kinds of attacks and resistances each of you has (and you can also learn more about <i>why</i>, if you want). In NetHack you even need comparatively rare items to learn with certainty what resistances <i>you</i> have at a particular moment; in Crawl you can pull this up on a convenient screen at any moment.<p>Religion is dramatically more important (and complicated!) in Crawl, and different gods significantly change your play style. In NetHack there are minor differences related to your god&#x27;s alignment which you would probably not need to think about in a typical game; there are always exactly 3 gods, of 3 distinct alignments, in a NetHack game.<p>Item identification (and modification) is much more important in NetHack. Artifacts (special, unique items with abilities different from their base type) are rare and you might find or use something like 1-4 of them in a typical NetHack game. In Crawl, they&#x27;re extremely widespread and you might find or use several dozen in a game, including ending up equipping 100% artifact weapons, armor, and jewelry by the end.<p>Your character class is more consequential in Crawl (there are comparatively larger differences in skills and intrinsics that result from it), though in NetHack it does result in a single completely unique per-character-class dungeon branch in each game.<p>As an example of the UI helpfulness difference: if you try to walk into lava in NetHack:<p>&gt; You fall into the lava! Your small shield bursts into flame! Your pair of leather gloves bursts into flame! You burn to a crisp...<p>In Crawl:<p>&gt; Why would you want to do that?<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s less than 600 words, but I hope it&#x27;s useful!<p>Edit: I like the sibling comment&#x27;s observation that Crawl is &quot;not simulation-y&quot;. To take one example, NetHack developers have thought a lot about gravity and circumstances where you or some object falls on top of you or some object or some trap and exactly what should happen then. And they&#x27;ve thought about what would, or wouldn&#x27;t, cause flasks to shatter or eggs to break, and what the consequences of that would be, and so on. Crawl basically doesn&#x27;t care about this: yes, if you stop flying and thereby fall into an unsurvivable place, you will die. Otherwise, nothing in Crawl ever falls on anything, and nothing ever shatters from impact. The extreme number of physical interactions that are simulated in Dwarf Fortress, and the resulting chains of causality, were reportedly inspired by NetHack. Dwarf Fortress has taken this much further and made the number of interactions radically larger, but NetHack does have this kind of flavor.<p>In Crawl, if you&#x27;re telling someone why you died, it&#x27;s generally &quot;a monster hit me and I died from the resulting damage&quot; (maybe with a surrounding tactical context about why you misjudged the fight). In NetHack, it could very often be something like &quot;I did X, which caused Y to happen, which caused Z to happen, which then killed me instantly&quot;. (Crawl requires you to have 0 or fewer hit points in order to die, except from starvation in older versions that tracked hunger and satiety; in NetHack there are probably 100 different ways to die other than by taking hit-point damage. Maybe 6 or 7 just related to drawbridges...)",AI/Data Science,,

4093,"Sure, dynamical ingredients like the jets carrying huge amount of luminous matter out of active galactic nuclei or the outflow from star forming activities and supernovae, for instance, have been raised as possible explanations for the apparently shallow increase in density of dark matter in galaxy cores (the &quot;cuspiness&quot; problem).   Roughly, dynamical process in cores can -- simply by gravitational interaction -- throw dark matter back out towards the halo along with the luminous matter.<p>One can also step up a scale level and consider that the distribution of peculiar velocities in galaxy clusters is consistent with plenty of dark matter inside galaxy clusters but outside galaxy halos.   This DM is bound to be stirred up by the moving galaxies, even if only gravitationally, and such dynamical processes will also affect the density of gas and dust in the cores of galaxy clusters (the cores of which need not be occupied by galaxies) too.<p>We need to explain peculiar motion of galaxy-cluster-members, and member-galaxy-vs-whole-cluster lensing behaviour too, and astronomical surveys of galaxies and clusters continue to provide plenty of data to test various theoretical approaches.  Those are what propose observable consequences of self-interaction (is there dark chemistry?  do dark matter particles collide and annihilate?) or is dark matter warmer than cold dark matter (if it&#x27;s a naturally warm gas, then it would have a hard time gathering in the cores of galaxies and clusters, much like a warm gas has trouble gathering on the floor of a laboratory compared to a very cold gas).  Or does it couple non-gravitationally but very weakly to baryons or electrons, such that it undergoes a phase change as one goes from the very dense cores of galaxies and gas-rich clusters towards the sparser edges?    If one proposes atmosphere-like dynamical processes at these scales, what are the observables one expects from astronomic spectroscopy?<p>Spirals are certainly interesting, but there are also elliptical galaxies where the outermost hydrogen gas is in arbitrary orbit in clouds of various sizes; unlike edge-on spirals, they don&#x27;t show a advancing-side&#x2F;receding-side red&#x2F;blueshift dipole, and where the rotating elements are large enough to measure significant dipoles, they do not strongly correlate with oblateness.    More intriguingly, the measurable red&#x2F;blue shift velocities of (groups of) stars within such galaxies are mostly <i>radial</i>, which is very different from what&#x27;s seen in spirals, where rotation dominates.    That radial speed is different from what would be seen if the luminous elements (including that that is luminous in infrared, radio, and so on, or material that produces absorption lines rather than emission ones) were all that determined these orbits.    But a cold dark matter halo explains -- or at least is in concord with -- those orbital velocity anomalies.<p>And as galaxy surveys continue, neat things like giant low-surface-brightness galaxies (and their substructures) will be found more often.  Their properties are good stress-tests of dark matter theories and alternatives, in that they should generate predictions for observations which will arrive within the next few years.  They are also probes of largest-scale structure formation, as so far they are not found in or near dense galaxy clusters.   If we start discovering GLSBs in dense regions, that would be a challenge to largest-scale distribution of dark matter as the driver of the cosmic web, which is the best current explanation of the distribution of galaxy clusters that are not gravitationally-bound with one another.",general,,

It’s probably best forgotten.<p>Marilyn Vos Savant published an incorrect answer to the Monte Hall problem. She got the correct answer from a lot of readers, including me. She then published a second incorrect answer claiming that all the letters she got—including from math PhDs were wrong. Finally she got the answer right—the one she undoubtedly got from any math PhD or intelligent person who wrote her—but continued to claim (a) that her previous answers were correct and (b) that all the letters were wrong.<p>As a result, the public is mostly misinformed about this simple problem.<p>The set-up is simple. There are three doors, one of which has a valuable prize behind it, and two of which have worthless prizes. You select one door. The host opens one of the other two doors to show you a worthless prize, and offers you the opportunity to switch your choice.<p>The key to this problem, which Marilyn finally saw in her third solution, is the knowledge and intentions of the host. If the host doesn’t know which door has the prize, there’s no reason to switch or not switch, it’s the same either way. If the host knows the door and is trying to hurt you, don’t switch. If the host knows the door and is trying to help you, switch.<p>Marilyn’s first answer was to always switch, regardless of the host’s intentions. This is also the answer that most people now believe. It’s a common error that people make all the time. That’s why people wrote in to correct her.<p>In order to justify her incorrect first answer, she claimed it was obvious that the host used the strategy of always opening a non-prize door and offering you the chance to switch. This does indeed justify switching. But that assumption was missing from her first and second answers, along with any discussion of the host’s knowledge and intentions mattering.<p>Her justification that the assumptions were too obvious to need stating was the actual television program Let’s Make a Deal, hosted by Monte Hall, which eventually gave the name to the problem. But anyone who watched the show knew that was not Monte’s strategy. Sometimes he opened another door and gave a chance to switch, sometimes he didn’t. He was well aware of the problem if he followed Marilyn’s assumed strategy, and was scrupulous about not giving any advantage to the contestant. You can tell this from statistics on the show—on average it didn’t pay to switch—and his published statements.<p>Clearly there are much bigger problems in the world, and it doesn’t pay to get upset about misinformation put out by popular vain people. If was very frustrating at the time, but it seems quaint that such things upset us in the 90s when there is so much worse information put out today by even more popular and more vain people.“",devops/OS,,

4152,"&gt; Richard Wolff explains different approaches here very eloquently <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_ywyLiNT3Cs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_ywyLiNT3Cs</a><p>Richard Wolff is total hack and the fringe of fringe fringe economics. Economic study of cooperative model within capitalism has shown the to be mostly not effective and not innovative. Success stories are few an far between and those that do exist usually are successful by copying existing business model.<p>There is a reason less then 1% of companies operate that way.<p>&gt; Meanwhile capitalism promotes top down decision making, and necessarily leads to centralization and monopolies.<p>Funny, if you read Marx you would assume that there would be less companies over time and an workers getting poor consistently.<p>The exact opposite has happened.<p>the idea that capitalism lead to top down decision making is frankly incredibly false. Within each company there is some level of top down decision making, but every company has a different culture and many different types of companies have success.<p>Some companies are large stock holder conglomerates where there is very little top down decision making and each sub-company operates mostly by themselves. Some companies are run by a visionary leader in a more top-down fashion but the good once take advice and ideas.<p>And on system level the idea that decision making in capitalism is top-down is simply verifiable and completely untrue. The highest political authority clearly does not set prices, in fact often when they do they fail and they clearly don&#x27;t make the economic choices for everybody.<p>Ok, lets go to the evil capitalist. Do they make all the choices? No clearly not. Even the richest capitalist only control small parts of companies that themselves are far less then % of the economy. And even the price and worth of those companies are defined in a decentralized way.<p>Meanwhile, not a single anarchy-syndicalist or even syndicalist system has ever actually worked for a modern economy for any length of time. The counter examples that Socialist often bring up, Basque country in the Spanish Civil war and so on are embracing examples of reaching compared to the global economy.<p>&gt; The game of monopoly is a perfect illustration of this where every player starts in a fair position and over time all the power ends up being consolidated with a single player while the rest of the players lose everything.<p>Monopoly the game was designed by a socialist to impose his idea of capitalism the form of a game. Its literally a game design to show how evil capitalism is.<p>But a little tip from me, don&#x27;t make up your philosophy based on a propaganda board game. All it shows that the guy who invented the board game is just as wrong as you.<p>&gt; This dynamic plays out in the real world as well. As companies compete, successful companies grow while unsuccessful ones die out or end up being absorbed by ones that are successful. As the company grows the amount of initial capital needed to compete with it grows as well. It&#x27;s pretty much impossible for a small startup to start competing with a company like Walmart or Amazon because these companies leverage advantages like economies of scale and brand recognition.<p>Funny how Walmart already existed when Amazon was created. Funny how IBM existed when Microsoft was created. The examples are literally countless.<p>You are literally using as an example, a company that is 25 years old. It existence proves that you are wrong. If your theory was actually correct, Amazon could never have been created in the first place.<p>Its always amazing to who socialism have predicted that all capitalism will centralize into one single big company, and after 200 years and the number of companies generally increasing they still make the exact same arguments. This does make a certain sense since socialism have for 200 years believed everything run by a single top-down operation would be the most efficient.<p>&gt; If we look at capitalist economies we can see that monopolies and cartels are prevalent in pretty much every domain from telecom industry to food production to media and most other domains.<p>And Tom Hanks has monopoly on playing Tom Hanks. Hollywood is full of monopolies.<p>If funny, you just divide up the whole market in to arbitrarily sized sub-markets, then declare each a monopoly. Then you realize that this is not actually the case so you divide the market further. And then its still not actually monopolies, and then you claim that they are cartels (mostly they are not).<p>So even if your argument would be right, it would still be wrong, because you simply assumed a nationalist point of few. Or are you claiming all telecom companies in the whole world are a cartel? All food production in the world is from a few companies? Funny, I know at least 5 farmers who own their own land and buy food from them.<p>Oh maybe you mean food distribution? Its not really true their either. But I guess if you divide the market long enough eventually your argument becomes true.<p>&gt; This is also incorrect seeing that capitalism predates communism, and communism developed as a response to capitalism. It&#x27;s also worth noting that communism and large public sector are the primary reasons why China is pretty much the only major growing economy after the pandemic. It&#x27;s pretty evident that this &quot;legacy&quot; system is currently doing a lot better than capitalism.<p>China is not Communist and anybody that claims it is just does it to score political points in the US political battles.<p>Funny enough China is a lot more like Imperial Russia then Soviet Union.",general,,

4174,"&gt; First off I want to note TI calculators are not anything special when it comes to assembler. It was more of a limitation of the platform (in order to get games that are fast, you had to write them in assembler because TI-BASIC was too slow).<p>&gt; Note also that assembly code is different for each CPU architecture. The TI calculator I had contained a z80 chip, so it was z80 assembler (Motorola assembler?). The x86 assembly language is a more complicated, but probably more useful to learn (can look at any program on your computer). Or maybe you could learn ARM assembly (e.g. this would allow you to write simple programs that blink lights on a Raspberri PI).<p>Sure, I understand all this already. I suspect that x86 assembly might be most useful for me, but I also have access to an Arduino, so I might try writing assembly for that as well.<p>&gt; 1.

4188,"&gt; To do this, the researchers first had to characterize the scattering medium precisely. At Utrecht University, they shone light through a layer of zinc oxide nanopowder deposited on a glass slide. They then used a detector on the other side to measure the light and analyse how it had been scattered by the powder. Once this has been done, Rotter explains, you can calculate “what kind of wave would be transmitted through this medium in the same way as through fresh space”.<p>So it&#x27;s not just any opaque material (and it&#x27;s not even &quot;opaque&quot;, really), and it&#x27;s not just any waveform.

I could have imagined taking a scattering medium and a desired final waveform and computing the initial waveform that would produce the final waveform, but this seems to be saying that there exist waveforms that are essentially fixed points of the transform induced by the scattering medium.

It receives one of its formal parameters &quot;by value.&quot; That parameter&#x27;s data is larger than a machine-register in size.<p>• The compiler uniformly generates the call-sites of this function to <i>provide</i> the address of the original data, passing it in a register. The call-sites of the function look the same whether or not the function does the copy.<p>• The compiler, by static analysis of the function, determines whether the function really <i>needs</i> a copy—i.e. whether it would <i>make a difference</i> to the code whether the copying ever happens.<p>• If it needs a copy, then the compiler generates the function to have a prologue that does a copy <i>from</i> the address in the caller-passed register <i>to</i> the address in the stack pointer; and then the compiler generates code that interacts with the copy as a local stack variable. (Because, after the copy, it is!)<p>• But if the function <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> actually &quot;need&quot; a copy, then the compiler generates no copy in the function prologue, and generates code for the function body that interacts with the original indirectly through the passed address in the register.&quot;<p>This has nothing-at-all to do with copy &quot;on&quot; write.

Let’s say I pick the door initially, then someone opens the goat door, and finally you decide whether to switch. In this scenario, you don’t have self-preference bias to stick with “my” original door. In fact, my decision was the irrelevant information.

A main cause may be that speaking up about a criminal colleague is only possible if you know for sure that he is guilty, meaning that you probably are a witness, and in such a case a colleague of the culprit.  There are many reasons for teammates to cover-up each other.  For example they may all be guilty of something (establishing a &quot;popular culture of corruption&quot;), or they may think that their colleague is guilty but should be pardoned given his merits (somewhat acting as judges).

4462,"Eh, I am not so sure.  After watching my kid go through Suzuki Method violin through Volume 10 (a Mozart concerto) -- my observation is that it is incredibly important to not practice-in mistakes.  The typical Suzuki Method attack is to identify &quot;special spots&quot; (you don&#x27;t tell a 4-year old that it is a &quot;difficult section&quot;) and for those special spots, identify drills that work that spot.  The spot is probably 1 or 2 measures long.  There are a lot of different technique-builder drills, but one example: In La Folia there is a challenging run, at performance tempo it is very fast, and the timing is a 7-tuple, if I recall.  One drill is to play that scale run forwards and backwards, slowly, concentrating on perfect intonation, even timing, and percussive finger landings.  Only when that drill is perfect, is that integrated into the piece.<p>So, no.  Don&#x27;t allow yourself to make mistakes.  Take the challenging section, come up with a drill for just that section, and work that section until it is perfect at the same tempo where you can play the rest of the piece.  The first rule of time-efficient practice is to spend your time on the sections that need perfecting!  Just playing the piece through over-and-over is not a good use of practice time.<p>Another thing that I found a bit mind-bending, given my own music education, is that our teacher had the philosophy that first you memorize the piece, and only after the piece is completely memorized without intonation and tempo mistakes, is it possible to start really working on perfecting it. That is the point where she really started teaching the piece. Maybe that is a violinist thing where there is a culture of memorization, but it was a bit of a new concept for me.<p>Another teacher at a violin camp used to say: &quot;After you first succeed, try, try again.&quot;  Meaning, don&#x27;t stop after you get it right!

Some older people have already made it long enough to go past that point, and they get into the same situations that retirees without any savings get into. i.e. you hear about old ladies subsisting on dog food because their only source of income is a small social security check.<p>A better mindset is the one used by the FIRE crowd, which applies just as well if you&#x27;re &quot;retired&quot; at 30 or 60: recognize index funds are not just pretty safe but also give a pretty high confidence minimal rate of return, plan for average x% returns per year, <i>and don&#x27;t withdraw more than x%</i> for income, so that your savings never decreases but in fact increases. This way you can retire whenever your savings hits the right number to support your required income indefinitely, rather than retiring when your savings hits the right number to provide income only for the next X years until you die.<p>(I shouldn&#x27;t have to say it but will: this is a theoretical optimal modeling strategy, reality will be messier, any real plan should analyze possible setbacks and ways to deal with them -- the easiest way typically being to seek work again for some period of time, which tends to be easier the more biologically young you are.

It is a generalization in any number of dimensions of the three-dimensional polyhedron. Polytopes may exist in any general number of dimensions n as an n-dimensional polytope or n-polytope. Flat sides mean that the sides of a (k+1)-polytope consist of k-polytopes that may have (k−1)-polytopes in common. For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope.&quot;<p>[...]<p>Polytopes in lower numbers of dimensions have standard names:<p>Dimension

It is named after H.S.M. Coxeter.[1]&quot;<p>Definitions<p>Note that this article assumes a finite Coxeter group. For infinite Coxeter groups, there are multiple conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements, and they have infinite order.<p>There are many different ways to define the Coxeter number h of an irreducible root system.<p>A Coxeter element is a product of all simple reflections. The product depends on the order in which they are taken, but different orderings produce conjugate elements, which have the same order.<p>The Coxeter number is the order of any Coxeter element;.
The Coxeter number is 2m&#x2F;n, where n is the rank, and m is the number of reflections. In the crystallographic case, m is half the number of roots; and 2m+n is the dimension of the corresponding semisimple Lie algebra.
If the highest root is ∑miαi for simple roots αi, then the Coxeter number is 1 + ∑mi.
The Coxeter number is the highest degree of a fundamental invariant of the Coxeter group acting on polynomials.&quot;<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coxeter_element#Coxeter_plane"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coxeter_element#Coxeter_plane</a><p>&gt;&quot;For a given Coxeter element w, there is a unique plane P on which w acts by rotation by 2π&#x2F;h. This is called the Coxeter plane[6] and is the plane on which P has eigenvalues e2πi&#x2F;h and e−2πi&#x2F;h = e2πi(h−1)&#x2F;h.[7] This plane was first systematically studied in (Coxeter 1948),[8] and subsequently used in (Steinberg 1959) to provide uniform proofs about properties of Coxeter elements.[8]<p>The Coxeter plane is often used to draw diagrams of higher-dimensional polytopes and root systems – the vertices and edges of the polytope, or roots (and some edges connecting these) are orthogonally projected onto the Coxeter plane, yielding a Petrie polygon with h-fold rotational symmetry.[9] For root systems, no root maps to zero, corresponding to the Coxeter element not fixing any root or rather axis (not having eigenvalue 1 or −1), so the projections of orbits under w form h-fold circular arrangements[9] and there is an empty center, as in the E8 diagram at above right. For polytopes, a vertex may map to zero, as depicted below. Projections onto the Coxeter plane are depicted below for the Platonic solids.<p>In three dimensions, the symmetry of a regular polyhedron, {p,q}, with one directed Petrie polygon marked, defined as a composite of 3 reflections, has rotoinversion symmetry Sh, [2+,h+], order h. Adding a mirror, the symmetry can be doubled to antiprismatic symmetry, Dhd, [2+,h], order 2h. In orthogonal 2D projection, this becomes dihedral symmetry, Dihh, [h], order 2h.<p>In four dimensions, the symmetry of a regular polychoron, {p,q,r}, with one directed Petrie polygon marked is a double rotation, defined as a composite of 4 reflections, with symmetry +1&#x2F;h[Ch×Ch][10] (John H.

My parents couldn’t figure out why. They thought it so impressive that I was so industrious to have these jobs. They loved the bootstrap narrative.<p>3. Working jobs in food service introduced me to all manner of drugs and alcohol. I was a regular smoker by 15, and binge drank with my coworkers from 16-19, and I smoked weed every chance I got.<p>I don’t really hold it against my parents consciously; they were older and really bought in to the bootstrap narrative. They genuinely thought I could work part time in the summer and pay for college, in the mid 2000s, just like my dad did in the 60s. But I do hold it against them subconsciously. I know there are things I really wanted to do back then that my family could hav afforded to pay for, and it’s a bitter pill to swallow knowing that they refused to out of misguided principles. I didn’t really realize that until I met my wife, who was told that it was her job to go to school and get good grades, not make money.

The trouble is in defining wild here - your point rests heavily on a definition along the lines of “shaped entirely by non-human forces” which is a circular argument.

Familial values aren&#x27;t only compatible with patriarchy, it can also mesh well with matriarchy (The fertility of women becoming important can also lead to women having more power over men, vice-versa).

The next &quot;step&quot; is 10-bit per channel with 3 channels (hence &quot;HDR10(+)&quot;), and so should fit quite well in 32 bits ?<p>(However, it would seem that even Dolby&#x27;s Perceptual Quantizer transfer function might need 12 bits per channel to avoid banding over the &quot;HDR&quot; Rec.2020&#x2F;2100-sized color gamut..?)",web/mobile,,

However, as one takes the dark matter density higher, these rare or weak self-interactions increase in number or strength.   At densities found deep enough within galaxy clusters and within individual galaxies the self-interaction produces a phase change that <i>increases</i> the intensity of interactions with ordinary matter at distances much greater than that of the diameters of atomic nuclei (but perhaps not infinite distances, as with electromagnetism).<p>This is somewhat backwards from the neutron star studies: they start with microscopic physical mechanisms (quark deconfinement, pion condensation, and other exotica) and extract a change in bulk behaviour.    By contrast, this family of dark matter idea starts with bulk behaviour and hopes to find microscopic physical mechanisms eventually.   Which really is not very different from the standard cosmology&#x27;s cold dark matter: bulk behaviour, but we haven&#x27;t found the particles that generate it.<p>But, turning to Ken Wilson (who is extremely important in generalized phase transitions [1]): <i>density</i> of discrete elements has an obvious length scale (the mean distance between the elements) and the phase-change idea is that above a certain length scale standard cosmology&#x27;s cold dark matter is a fine effective theory; below that length scale, that effective theory needs adaptation.   In these theories there&#x27;s a singular point in the dark matter energy_density-viscosity curve, and on one side of that point the perfect fluid approximation is accurate for all practical purposes, and on the other additional parameters become <i>relevant</i>.  Or turning it around, one recovers the standard perfect fluid cold dark matter from a model with additional parameters as one takes those parameters to zero, and thus the standard perfect fluid is <i>emergent</i>.   And in turn as one studies the microscopic details of the superfluid, it is almost certain to emerge from something else, probably but not necessarily a quantum field theory.<p>- --<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nobelprize.org&#x2F;prizes&#x2F;physics&#x2F;1982&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nobelprize.org&#x2F;prizes&#x2F;physics&#x2F;1982&#x2F;press-release...</a> [quick overview of Wilson&#x27;s prize-winning work] and <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;how-quantum-field-theory-becomes-effective&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;how-qua...</a> [renormalization] and <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;25&#x2F;thanksgiving-5&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;25&#x2F;thanksgi...</a> [effective field theory more generally]",AI/Data Science,,

In maths this means that<p>P(a,b | x, y) = sum_i P(i) P(a|x, i) P(b|y,i)<p>Basically we&#x27;re allowing the output bits to depend on some shared randomness P(i), but we&#x27;re not allowing a to depend on y and we&#x27;re not allowing b to depend on x. This is reasonable because we have the freedom to put x in a after we receive b from y, or vice-versa, or have them separated by arbitrary amounts of space, or whatever we like.<p>It turns out that the probability distribution P(a,b|x,y) that quantum mechanics predicts is not of this form. The probability distributions we observe in reality, when we actually do the experiment are also not of this form.

The callee copies the pointed-to object into memory allocated by the callee.<p>This immediately has the advantage of less binary bloats, because the amount of parameter copying instructions in the binary will become O(number of functions) rather than O(number of function calls). (As an aside: That can probably be a huge advantage for C++ with its large, inlined copy constructors.)<p>When the copy is made in the callee, we can start identifying cases where a copy isn&#x27;t necessary, or cases where only certain parts of the struct has to be copied. It would have to be fairly conservative though, since unlike with your ABI, there would be no guarantee made by the caller that there are no other references to the parameter.<p>I think my version is a clear and obvious improvement over the status quo, with decreased binary sizes and as good or better performance. Your version is more risky where the worst case is two copies per large parameter but, your version will probably achieve zero copies in way more cases than my version. &quot;Low risk &#x2F; medium reward&quot; versus &quot;medium risk &#x2F; probably high reward&quot;.<p>---<p>Anyways, I might end up writing a blog post on this stuff.

5602,"It is about how current draw is in or out of phase with voltage. Purely resistive loads won&#x27;t affect the phase of the current.

This leaves you with less power.<p>In Germany going lower than cosphi 0.9 capacitive or cosphi 0.9 inductive requires special permission from the operator of the electrical grid.<p>If your installation affects the electrical grid in negative ways they can make you pay when something breaks or switch of your power to protect the grid.<p>On top of cosphi you also have ripple (basically &quot;overtones&quot; created by non-linear loads like unfiltered switching PSUs). If your THC (total harmonic current) exceeds 5% any power transformers in your net will have significantly reduced lifetime. But German grid operators allow a maximum THC of 15%.<p>So basically there are many ways how inductive, capacitive or switching loads can &quot;deform&quot; and shift the waveforms of the currents and voltages you are drawing, some of this can have negative effects on your own devices, some of it can have negative effects on the grid.

Doing it in in a roundabout way via inflation is a psychological trick - you are saying, &quot;Well, laws can&#x27;t be passed to do it, so we will use this crazy constant-devaluation of everyone&#x27;s money to accomplish it&quot; and the new money doesn&#x27;t go to the people you want to help directly. Furthermore, poor people with tiny amounts of savings can&#x27;t even begin to save as their money is constantly debased. I don&#x27;t see this as an argument against deflation.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &quot;psychological trick&quot;. Nobody is tricking anyone, if <i>steady</i> and moderate inflation is the goal of a competent central bank.<p>&gt; Furthermore, poor people with tiny amounts of savings can&#x27;t even begin to save as their money is constantly debased. I don&#x27;t see this as an argument against deflation.<p>But they can take on ever-debased debt!<p>&gt; It is matters of degree to me. The US has defaulted twice in the last 100 years, first with the confiscation of gold in the 30s and later with the outright withdrawal from the gold standard in the 70s. You can argue whatever you want, but that is a de-facto default when the rules that were promised are suddenly changed at gunpoint, and now past promises are now longer valid. I see the US and other &quot;well-functioning liberal democracies&quot; as easily able to slip into being monetary basket cases, as they have been several times over history. The 1970s&#x2F;80s had absurd levels of inflation in the US which shows the situation can change rapidly. I think there is a high-risk of 10%+ inflation in the US right now.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure I&#x27;d call the US a well-functioning liberal democracy, but I&#x27;d definitely not call withdrawing from the gold standard defaulting. Besides, isn&#x27;t inflation-targeting at central banks a relatively new invention?<p>And let&#x27;s be entirely clear: if most experts saw a high risk for imminent 10%+ inflation, they would be given a very very loud microphone. Your view is a fringe one.<p>&gt; The finance sector in all western democracies is a large component of GDP - far higher than what it would be in a hard-money system IMO. Those closer to the money printer somehow get a larger share of it. Always happens.<p>Along the lines of what you wrote above: let&#x27;s pass laws to change that then.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t see why we need to artificially encourage people to spend. People should spend if they want something, not because of seizing their money if they choose not to spend. As I said before, people will always need goods and services. &quot;Hoarding&quot; money is just someone choosing to delay their gratification, which I see as a good thing.<p>That&#x27;s your personal view. Easy access to money is an important mechanism for people with actual good ideas to realize them. In a society where hoarding is &quot;artificially encouraged&quot; instead (see, both of us can play the game of inserting loaded adverbs or adjectives ;)), this mechanism stops functioning properly.<p>&gt; My point is not to say why they deflated. My point is that there was deflation, and it didn&#x27;t cause any problems. Economists act like the sky will fall if deflation occurs. It happened in computers and it was awesome.<p>Computers are not currency. I want different properties for goods and for currency. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very original desire.<p>&gt; Yes? Why should citizens-of-the-future pay for what citizens-of-the-now want? Actually paying for things would cause an honest discussion of what people are willing to pay for. If you tell people they can have everything they want for free, of course they want it. This is the weakest argument of all.<p>Are you doubting the usefulness of debt at all?<p>&gt; You act is if the rich don&#x27;t accumulate capital now. I find this argument invalid. In reality it&#x27;s the poor that can&#x27;t easily escape inflation and lose their money, while the rich are able to continue to accumulate wealth above the rate of inflation using their vast array of wealth advisors and tax lawyers. The poor are the ones without an easy way to protect their wealth in an inflationary world.<p>They do, of course. But you&#x27;re suggesting we use &quot;psychological tricks&quot; to <i>incentivize</i> this behavior!<p>I certainly share your opinion that something needs to be done about the super-wealthy.

(I&#x27;d like to introduce the XY problem of the second kind for this, where the answerer is so confident that it is the answerer who missed the actual question.)<p>Some regexes <i>can</i> recognize a language beyond the regular language. They are typically available in two flavors: recursive references (Perl, Ruby, PCRE) and stackable captures (.NET). They are obscure enough that I would not recommend them, but it is patently false that regular expressions (EDIT: of the practical interest) cannot be recursive.<p>It is possible to match individual HTML tags with regexes, but it <i>is</i> difficult. It cannot use a bare `\w` or `\s` because HTML5 parsers have peculiar definitions for tag name characters and space characters. For example your `\s` will typically match various Unicode space characters, while only ASCII whitespaces are recognized in tags. There are also several notable exceptions to the parser (and external states termed the &quot;tree construction&quot;), so missing any of them would result in an immediate XSS. If you think you can write a correct regex for HTML tags, my quizzes [1] should make you concerned. Limiting the question to XHTML does alleviate some but not all concerns.<p>The distinction between recognition and parsing is correct, but parsing doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the reconstruction of parse tree. Parsing means the access to constituent nonterminals, which can be used to reconstruct parse tree but also directly used as their own (e.g. calculators). Indeed in most regex implementations you can&#x27;t extract more than two strings out of each capture (Raku is a notable exception), so you can match against e.g. `(\w+)(?:,(\w+))*` but can&#x27;t extract a list of comma-separated words with it. Practically speaking this means you can&#x27;t extract a list of attributes with a single regex, making it unsuitable for HTML parsing anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26355451"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26355451</a>",web/mobile,,

5898,"The only part I agree in this writing is that you don&#x27;t need to be snarky to be correct. (I&#x27;d like to introduce the XY problem of the second kind, where the answerer is so confident that it is the answerer who have missed the actual question.)<p>Some regexes <i>can</i> recognize a language beyond the regular language. They are typically available in two flavors: recursive references (Perl, Ruby, PCRE) and stackable captures (.NET). They are obscure enough that I would not recommend them, but it is patently false that regular expressions (EDIT: of the practical interest) cannot be recursive.<p>It is possible to match individual HTML tags with regexes, but it <i>is</i> difficult. It cannot use a bare `\w` or `\s` because HTML5 parsers have peculiar definitions for tag name characters and space characters. For example your `\s` will typically match various Unicode space characters, while only ASCII whitespaces are recognized in tags. There are also several notable exceptions to the parser (and external states termed the &quot;tree construction&quot;), so missing any of them would result in an immediate XSS. If you think you can write a correct regex for HTML tags, my quizzes [1] should make you concerned. Limiting the question to XHTML does alleviate some but not all concerns.<p>The distinction between recognition and parsing is correct, but parsing doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the reconstruction of parse tree. Parsing means the access to constituent nonterminals, which can be used to reconstruct parse tree but also directly used as their own (e.g. calculators). Indeed in most regex implementations you can&#x27;t extract more than two strings out of each capture (Raku is a notable exception), so you can match against e.g. `(\w+)(?:,(\w+))*` but can&#x27;t extract a list of comma-separated words with it. Practically speaking this means you can&#x27;t extract a list of attributes with a single regex, making it unsuitable for HTML parsing anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26355451"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26355451</a>",web/mobile,,

We submitted a simple patch that just introduced a kcmdline parameter to disable cpuid based calibration and fall back to msr-based method that works fine.

5951,"&gt; If it’s too easy to memorize, choose a bigger section.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work with fast passages where the pianist must feel how to use the momentum to their advantage. Better path-- choose a small enough section that may be played <i>immediately</i> at the preferred tempo.<p>&gt; Practice the section slowly enough, at first, to avoid making mistakes.<p>By playing a bite-sized segment of music at the preferred performance tempo <i>from the outset</i>, the pianist can greatly simplify the entire section in the author&#x27;s step 2 here.<p>Example of the problem:<p>1. Pianist breaks up a difficult passage in the development section of the 3rd movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Appassionata Sonata and applies a comfortable, sensible fingering.<p>2. Pianist ramps up the tempo.<p>3. Eventually, pianist hits a critical tempo where the  fingering turns out to work against the momentum of their hand.<p>4. Pianist realizes that the new momentum of the faster tempo opens up a <i>new possibility</i> for a fingering-- e.g., just throw the thumb at a new position and let the torque from the forearm land it correctly. If the rest of the arm&#x2F;shoulder stays loose that torque is a strong and reliable way to reposition the hand.<p>5. Pianist now has learned <i>two</i> fingerings that compete in their muscle memory-- one for the <i>wrong</i> tempo, which they learned first and methodically ratcheted up, and one for the <i>right</i> tempo which is newer and must be drilled more than the old fingering.<p>6. Pianist drills away at new fingering alone in a practice room.<p>7. New fingering becomes comfortable and seemingly secure.<p>8. Pianist goes plays at a different location, in front of <i>other people</i>, and that <i>wrong</i> fingering stabs at their brain like a black magic spell.<p>This is all avoided by a) practicing small segments of music at the preferred tempo b) joining them together to divide and conquer the piece.<p>Anyway, this is a common problem for a few reasons:<p>1. Pianists have a general reluctance to choose <i>very small</i> segments of music to practice.<p>2. Pianists have a propensity to choose pieces that are too difficult for their current skill level. This means they won&#x27;t come armed with general-purpose fingerings for virtuosic passages, making them likely to choose <i>wrong</i> fingerings when starting to learn virtuosic passages at slow tempos.<p>3. Music cognition is an early science. Most amateur pianists know the feeling of playing something wrong even once and then feeling how their body somehow memorizes that mistake and haunts their entire practice. But even professional pianists don&#x27;t have a shortcut for turning that experience on its head-- i.e., there&#x27;s no way to play a thing correctly <i>once</i> and have one&#x27;s body memorize that feeling as solidly as it memorizes a single mistake!",web/mobile,,

If you wanted your application to be certified for Windows 95, you needed to support OLE 2. OLE 2 was pushed at all the Microsoft Developer conferences.

Microsoft&#x27;s Visual C++ MFC framework supported OLE 2, and in fact, their Scribble tutorial included a section on implementing OLE 2. Visual Basic supported OLE 2, and in fact their custom controls were OLE 2 objects.<p>Thus if you supported OLE 2, you had a ton of documentation, tooling, libraries, dev environments that supported it. You could get Windows 95 application certification. You would be able to embed Office documents in your application, or have Office embed your documents in Office. IIRC, Visio started out as an independent application that had great OLE 2 support and was eventually acquired by Microsoft. And you could tell that OLE 2 was a huge priority for Microsoft. In fact, the rumored next generation successor to Windows 95 and Windows NT, Cairo was supposed to be built on OLE 2 from the ground up. (Cairo never materialized).<p>On the other hand you had OpenDoc, which did not have nearly as big of a market. It was not the priority for any of the companies pushing it.

6205,"Catching problems before things are written is definitely better and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s often a good idea to mention how you intend to approach problems in your daily sync. If someone has concerns, they can bring it up.<p>But if that fails, it is definitely better to review and catch it after the code is written than to submit badly written code out of fear of wasted effort. In my experience the vast majority of tasks are easily addressed by a single person and most proficient programmers will usually produce perfectly adequate code which doesn&#x27;t raise any concerns. Having reviews to catch the odd lapse in judgement or logical misstep doesn&#x27;t usually add a lot of overhead (as opposed to allocating two programmers to every menial task) but saves a lot more time and effort in avoided bugs and issues than the cost of having to rewrite something every now and then.<p>Additionally, any single submit should be kept to a manageable size so that they&#x27;re easier to review and issues are caught early. The only times I can remember having insisted someone rewrite something non-trivial have been when they misunderstood some fundamental issue, did not communicate progress as they should have, and did not follow guidelines of solving a single task per submit. That type of behaviour is in itself a pattern which needs to be addressed.",web/mobile,,

6264,"For many people, there&#x27;s a lot they can do to turn back the clock if they wish to do so. Sometimes it&#x27;s just knowing what&#x27;s possible.<p>In my thirties, I was so consumed with career that I let my health go, I was very overweight, didn&#x27;t exercise and just put all my focus into work and getting ahead. I developed all types of health problems and pictures of me from that time look like a fat old baby with a beard. It didn&#x27;t help that I was still wearing clothes from the 90&#x27;s. Quite embarrassing and I keep pictures from that era buried deep deep below the earth&#x27;s mantle :)<p>At age 40, I was recently out of a long-term relationship and moved to a new place and decided to get my health in order. I fixed my diet, started working out, updated my wardrobe, prioritized sleep, etc.<p>Over the next year, I dropped the extra weight, put on quite a bit of muscle, dressed for the correct era, and overall re-made myself.<p>A nice surprise was that losing weight and getting in shape resolved nearly all my health issues. I felt like I was in my twenties again - which was a small miracle since I felt like I was a senior citizen in my thirties.<p>Naturally, my mood and confidence improved. I was dating again, and quickly realized that sexiness-gap is much more of a factor than age-gap. If there&#x27;s no age-gap, but you&#x27;re waaaay less sexy than someone else, society will have a problem with it. But even if there&#x27;s a large age gap, and you are both at similar levels of &quot;sexy&quot;, then society accepts it quite readily. Not saying that is good or bad - it&#x27;s just how our modern society seems to be and was something surprising to me.<p>Here are some things that helped me:<p>* Set the barrier to working out as low as possible. I used resistance-bands at home. It&#x27;s surprising how much muscle you can put on with resistance-bands. Set yourself up for success - it&#x27;s a much lower hurdle to working out if you can just roll out of bed and workout in your underwear while listening to music&#x2F;audiobook&#x2F;etc. You can get super heavy-duty bands that even bodybuilders will struggle with - so don&#x27;t think you <i>have</i> to go to the gym to put on significant muscle. You don&#x27;t need to make a big financial investment here - your muscles will grow when working against significant resistance and they don&#x27;t really care <i>how</i> they get it - just that they get it in sufficient volume and consistency.<p>* Ignore fad diets and follow only science&#x2F;evidence based programs. The best I&#x27;ve found are &quot;Renaissance Periodization&quot; and Jeff Nippard. You want to follow those who are non-religious about any particular approach and willing to adjust their approach purely based on the best studies. I wasted soooo much time following crazy diets and fad workouts before I found good reliable data to work with, and that made all the difference.<p>* Focus on the 99% that matters for diet and exercise. The essentials are very simple. But if you&#x27;re looking for info on youtube and other places, the majority of videos&#x2F;articles are focusing on optimizing the 1%. So you can waste a lot of time worrying about the 1% that matters very little and miss the 99% that matters immensely. Remember that fitness experts often get bored of focusing on the basics and will want to constantly explore the exotic fringes. Ignore the exotic fringes - they will be a huge waste of your time unless you are an elite athlete competing in world-class competitions.<p>* Track what you eat in a calorie&#x2F;macro counter app - at least until you get reliable intuition about it. I resisted this for a long time, but when I finally did it, I realized that my diet was insane. I was 900 calories one day and 4000 calories another day. My intuition about food and calories was terrible. It wasn&#x27;t until I started counting calories that I realized what was what. Figuring out my maintenance calories also helped me to keep my energy levels more constant (my 900 calorie days were, non-surprisingly, the days I felt like a wet bag of sand).<p>* For style, I found Pinterest to be a surprisingly good resource. If you find a style you like that is contemporary and works well for your age, body-type, etc, then you can find thousands of photos that provide good examples. Save all the ones you like and then go through them and look for patterns. Pay attention to colors, fit, etc. Start replacing your current wardrobe with the most common items that work well in the pictures. Observe what is working for others that are similar to you, and start modeling your style after them. This may feel a bit &quot;vain&quot; - but remember, you&#x27;re not doing anyone any favors by showing up in poor style - do it for others if that helps you overcome that mental hurdle.<p>* Be patient and gentle with yourself. Taking a note from the parent article: If you notice your dog got fat and out of shape, would you whip him and shame him, or gently encourage him and make it fun to exercise? Treat yourself at least as good as a dog you love. This will take time. The changes will be extremely subtle in the short-term, but will make a big difference long-term. Loving your inner animal will ensure it goes as fast as possible. Shaming or punishing your inner animal will only slow things down and cause you to resent the process. Be creative - make it fun - only boring people get bored.<p>Most people let themselves atrophy as they age - so you may be surrounded by bad examples that will depress you about aging. Focus instead on the examples of people who are active, growing, and living amazing lives well into their 80&#x27;s. Then the future of aging won&#x27;t seem so dark.",general,,

A new iOS release or a new AWS service has far more impact on developers than any new Microsoft Windows feature.<p>Joel has a great writeup on this from some time back:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;06&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-microsoft-lost-the-api-war&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;06&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-microsoft-lost...</a>",devops/OS,,

29,"Why can&#x27;t people just eat vegetables instead? Seriously, I&#x27;ve worked at a renown vegan and vegetarian restaurant and I never understood why people didn&#x27;t just eat veg&#x2F;tofu stir-fry instead of having us go through so much non-sense to re-invent a burger or a crabcake? The things took so much effort and were an inferior version to the real thing, not to mention the amount of oils necessary to keep them intact.<p>The closest thing we had was this creole veg serve with polenta, that had tons of oil and butter in the polenta and the creole veg had been marinated in quite a bit of oil along with the spices to keep them moist throughout service.<p>I&#x27;m an omnivore with a massive conservationist mindset, and did Biodynamic Ag. So I just intermittent fast for 16 hours a day and only eat once a day now that I don&#x27;t farm any more. But I grew up on cantonese food where protein was used sparingly, and unlike most kids in the West we gladly ate tofu and vegetables all year round in our homemade meals.<p>Eating unadulterated seasonal veg is way tastier than eating a mushroom burger with absurd amounts of oils and saturated fats and breading, smeared with vegan mayo etc... I never ate anything but the soups at work, as the rest of the menu all had so much more stuff added to it that caused a very noticeable feeling of inflammation--which is typical for vegetarians and vegans.<p>I&#x27;ve ate those impossible burgers when BK launched them and did side by side with a normal whopper when they were on the 2&#x2F;$5 promo for a while, and the way I ate them (I sauted onions with korean BBQ sauce and garnished with kimchi and maybe an egg if I really had time) you couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.<p>But, as a cook I was always perplexed: why put so much inputs into something (burger) that wasn&#x27;t meant to be eaten more than once a week?<p>The real issue to the obesity issue in much of the West is a lack of exercise coupled with over consumption of calories, from all sources be it veg or animal protein, instead of having a burger as a treat once a week: many people, mainly the poor, subsist on this stuff due to the race to the bottom price wars typical in fast food paired with a sedentary lifestyle. But the price factor is not as day and night as it&#x27;s made out to be if you actually have an education on diets suited for your lifestyle, something entirely missing in the US.<p>I think post-covid people need to take a very serious look at who was really affected by COVID in the West--I&#x27;m aware that India is getting hit hard and they have a mainly plant based diet, but this seems mainly due to an inability to convince it&#x27;s population to follow lock-down, quarantine, or mask wearing measures and an ability to vaccinate due to an ongoing lack of trust in their government.<p>Most of the deaths in the West were from the elderly population, and the medically ill with a remarkable concentration on people with diabetes, obesity, asthma as the co-morbidity factors.",general,,

Finally, we can assess survey respondents’ feelings of white victimization from their answers to the question of how much discrimination whites face in the U.S., also on a five-point scale, ranging from “none at all” to a “great deal.”<p>These people are opposed to affirmative action.

107,"It&#x27;s indeed a problem that has happened to me, which is why I like to make the macro like<p><pre><code>    for DEFER(init, exit) {
    }
</code></pre>
or at least give it a name that indicates clearly that this is syntactically a loop. That&#x27;s like with some iteration macros that I like to use as well from time to time. The basic idea is to never try to hide what you&#x27;re doing, since that will backfire. You can still take a balanced approach with DRY and separation of concerns principles, which can lead to reasonable macros.<p>&gt; and that&#x27;s just one example of the many thing that can go wrong because it is a macro.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to say that nothing can go wrong in above usage, or at the very least it would take criminal energy to break it (I really can&#x27;t come up with a case right now).<p>It&#x27;s perfectly doable to write safe macros with only a little experience. Follow these simple rules when defining macros: 1) parenthesize usages of macro params, and parenthesize the whole macro body if it is a complete expression. 2) Use parameters that take syntactical expressions only once, to prevent evaluating side-effects (like x++) multiple times.<p>Linux kernel even allows for variable declaration in macros by using expression statement blocks (GCC extension). Although I&#x27;ve never had a need for them, I believe that with this approach you can fulfill rule 2) in all possible situations.<p>You can improve macro safety in cases where you need to define a macro that is a little dangerous by just capitalizing the macro&#x27;s name to make clear at the call site to be a little bit careful here. The thing is, there is no need to be 100% safe. It&#x27;s very good to be 99% safe and have a simple to use mechanism. Because there are always so many other ways to break your programming, and if you&#x27;re trying to be 100% safe at the cost of being twice as hard to use, that&#x27;s effectively a net loss because you&#x27;re provoking problems in other ways.<p>&gt; On the other hand, with RIAA, you just have your file_handle that automatically close so you can&#x27;t forgot to close it, and the rules are well known and not that difficult to understand.<p>Could agree if it&#x27;s a file handle or something other off-the-shelf thing where you don&#x27;t have to make the class yourself, and everybody instinctively is aware of the implicit behaviour.

568,"Re: the chimera vs mosaic, that&#x27;s not particularly true.<p>If I take a known virus and make a single mutation (insertion of a furin site in this case), then I wind up with the same virus, + a furin. If I take that mutated virus, and then passage it through multiple generations in lab grown hosts, it will mutate at random throughout the genome.<p>The exact rate and the time it would take is heavily debated, but one important note is that viruses with an RNA-dependant RNA polymerase are, as an evolutionary strategy, quite poor at preserving their own genetic information. They have the highest error rate of replication of any known organism. Which means, after some discrete amount of generations, you could wind up with some sort of &quot;mosaic&quot; + &quot;chimeric&quot; virus. Again though, how many generations is under hot dispute.

570,"Well, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a bit muddled. Pure STM systems have seen limited success, mostly on the jvm, particularly clojure. But as a technology it&#x27;s not spread widely in the industry, despite the fundamental advantage of composability. I personally would attribute this to a sort of gulf created by two common approaches:<p>1. It&#x27;s become very common to structure software as a stateless service cluster backed by a stateful database technology. Most of the databases used in this approach would not be described as STM, but the net effect to the application is similar, even if involving more layers and complexity.<p>2. People have gotten pretty comfortable with simple mutex patterns connected by queues of various sorts. This is a sort of worse is better situation, where the simplicity and high performance of a mutex protected whatever in a toy test or microbenchmark is far more efficient than STM. However, a system composed of many of these mutex protected islands proves a whole different beast indeed. STM has largely been criticized from the perspective of the former, vs the latter.<p>There are many people who have made the observation that transactional concurrency control, state of the art garbage collection, and even file systems have been converging on similar features. This is being driven by the common constrains on both sides of what hardware and humans expect. In particular with persistent memory, I think you&#x27;ll see all three of these unify into a single design, because systems that attempt to solve these problems separately will have very inferior match to the hardware.",web/mobile,,

683,"This is great work, but it almost makes me sad that you have to do this. I spent the earliest parts of my software career implementing full spectrum geospatial intelligence product generation algorithms for US intelligence agencies and the military. Part of the code base was software that does exactly this, but not with the historical, hand-drawn maps, but with the most current maps generated from aerial and space-borne radar sensing, as well as non-USGS data of, say, the ocean floor generated by US Navy sonar surveying programs. We could generate a map of any arbitrary coordinate boundaries of any part of the earth in seconds, using data that was at most a few years old.<p>There is absolutely no reason any of this code needs to be classified, as the maps themselves are not, the GeoTIFF format and tiling procedures are completely open standards, and the NGA has even open sourced some libraries for doing this kind of thing, but so much of the code that does this really quickly and efficiently, directly on your own workstation using C++ native executables into formats that can be rendered by a standard image viewer, is tied up in proprietary and even classified code bases just because of the monorepo nature of early work and the fact that development was done entirely on the classified systems because of the difficulty in developing on unclassified systems and then transferring across the air gap.<p>This is slowly changing, and in fact what I am presently working on is automated transfer and assurance mechanisms so more development that doesn&#x27;t need to be classified can be done on open systems and work shared, but it&#x27;s unfortunate to see so many wheels being reinvented when there are already really, really good tools to do these kinds of things but they are kept hidden.<p>We also have up-to-date indexed catalogs of exactly which tiles exist in which scale ranges to solve the problem you noted of trying to query and getting no data for poorly mapped regions. We can automatically retrieve the best data available and interpolate to the desired scale range instead. And rather than only getting the GeoTIFF, you can also get the raw altitude data intended for machine consumption, which is the main geoint use case for doing projections from sensor ephemeris to ground point.<p>I can see you also forked proj4js. This is of course also the kind of thing we had heavily optimized code for doing, since you have to project from lat&#x2F;lon to ECF in order to project from ground to coordinates in orbit, which are ECF (we had a need to do this before the open source libproj for C existed).<p>In any case, it&#x27;s unfortunate that you seemingly need to work for free doing this to get any attention and I hope you get a job out of it eventually. Sad to say I don&#x27;t think any of the big aerospace and intelligence players would give you a second look because of a basic requirement that everyone has a degree in engineering, physics, applied math, or computer science, but hopefully a more innovative, disruptive, and agile company will give you a look.

Applications are more likely to be web-based or services - i.e. inherently distributed - and less likely to be desktop or traditional client&#x2F;server, where almost all compute happened on a single server. As distributed services, maximizing statelessness and avoiding mutable shared memory is key to solving a lot of problems: scaling out (no shared memory), redundancy (keep a second copy of the application logic running somewhere, no sync required), recovery and idempotence (if something fails, try again until it succeeds - repeated attempts are safe).<p>Reliable persistent queues are part of that. They let you bring services up and down and switch over without down time, or restart after a failure and resume where they left off.<p>The problems of shared mutable state are best kept in specialized applications: databases, queuing systems, distributed caches, consistent key-value stores. Keeping state consistent in a distributed system is a genuinely hard problem, and STM isn&#x27;t much help, except perhaps as an implementation detail in some of those specialized applications.",devops/networking,,

It&#x27;s nice when a more modern take on shell scripting is nicer than that.<p>I will also say when I&#x27;m evaluating libraries for things like shell scripting, I look for things like this, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t score any points when I see stuff like this.",web/mobile,,

951,"&gt;Conversely, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum have decentralized the process of issuing and managing a currency. But while the operations of such currencies, based on blockchains, have been fully decentralized, the trust graph of these cryptocurrencies have remained entirely centralized. Everyone need to trust Bitcoin to transact in Bitcoin, and everyone needs to trust Ethereum to transact in Ethereum or assets issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The centralized nature of the trust involved in these cryptocurrencies being actually at the core of how these currencies operate, as the only viable way to properly incentivize a proof-of-work system.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful to equivocate the trust one places in an open decentralized system with the trust someone puts in a custodian of their money to not run off with it. That&#x27;s like equivocating trusting end-to-end encryption to keep your messages secure with trusting Facebook to keep your messages secure. Sure, in both cases there&#x27;s a risk, but one is based on your understanding of an open system, and the other is based on a guess that the custodian you&#x27;re trusting your data to won&#x27;t choose to or accidentally expose it. Just because the word &quot;trust&quot; can be used for both doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t significant differences between them.<p>I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users doesn&#x27;t seem useful in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>The scalability of this system seems interesting, but I think the scalability upgrades that cryptocurrency is getting from sharding and rollups will keep cryptocurrency scalable enough for human commerce purposes. I wonder if details of this system would be more useful in some kind of scenario of machine swarms bartering with each other, maybe in a situation where a common currency specifically doesn&#x27;t make sense and is undesirable, or where there&#x27;s no reasonable-latency access to the common blockchain because of the isolation of the network.

6781,"&gt; the 3-pointer by itself isn’t point-maximizing<p>Of course, but the reality is that analytics have proven that there are only really two shots worth taking in modern basketball: the 3 pointer and a shot near the rim. For anything in between the expected points for the shot is simply not worth it. Even an uncontested midrange shot is going to have similar or fewer expected points per shot than a contested 3-pointer or shot beneath the rim. And these two kinds of shots are spatially far from each other, so even if the opposing team knows this is your strategy, its still difficult to defend against. Teams and players that have tried to exploit the fact that modern basketball is fairly homogenous by taking relatively less defended midrange shots occasionally find streaks of success, but it hasn&#x27;t proven sustainable, and certainly not enough to win a championship.<p>Basketball would probably benefit from either eliminating the 3 point shot, or, perhaps preferably, pushing the line back a few feet to even it out in terms of point expectations with midrange shots. Shots under the rim will still remain the most reliable point source, but teams won&#x27;t have to divide as much attention on getting steam-rolled by three pointers. It will bring back scoring big men like a prime Shaq who have mostly disappeared from the game, still allow phenoms like Steph Curry to thrive (fewer players can match his ability to hit 3-pointers from further distance), and will make the midrange focused strategies more viable again.",web/mobile,,

Looks like it worked.<p>&gt; And of the papers arguing lockdowns work, they&#x27;re all free of methodology errors in your view?<p>I&#x27;ve spot checked a couple and the quality of the analysis was considerably higher. They generally rested on much sturdier statistics, like estimating effect size of policy interventions on R, which don&#x27;t rely on cherry picking pre-spike Swedish data.<p>&gt;  You should see huge sudden drops or surges when lockdowns and mask mandates are imposed or released<p>No, you would expect to see hard-fought dips in R after major interventions. Booms and crashes will act as a threshold on integrated R because such is the nature of exponential growth.<p>To be clear, these interventions frequently lead policy -- they can come from other countries, they can happen through policy of major institutions, ad campaigns, even distribution of news stories regarding other countries. Also, policy lags and suffers from inefficacy from people ignoring and even fight mandates, and this particular brand of inefficacy should be factored out for normative purposes. All of this dampens the effect and spreads it out in time. You would expect the dips in R to be messy but measurable given generous windows, and they are.<p>More than that, virus transmission isn&#x27;t a cosmic mystery. We know exactly how it happens and the mechanism by which lockdowns impact its transmission is so straightforward that even medieval plague doctors were able to get it correct. The &quot;lockdowns are ineffective&quot; hypothesis needs some serious magical thinking even before you start cherry-picking data and ignoring confounding variables.

6991,"&gt; Perhaps the dynamic queries may be easier with the query builder, but you still find out about issues at the same time as raw sql&#x2F;string templates.<p>As with everything, its a tradeoff and a matter of taste. SQL Query builders give you the flexibility of SQL, without relying on string concatenation directly, and making sure all the values are passed in order. Also, they usually can be extended to support multiple databases&#x2F;adapters (imagine specifying values as $1, $2... vs ?,?, quoting identifiers using &quot; or `, etc). They also usually fit better than plain strings in heavily programmatic contexts (imagine a query with different fields and filters depending on the value of a given field).<p>&gt; You cannot check that the query is correct for a given schema (missing tables&#x2F;cols etc), but I think many typed languages would allow you to ensure the AST is correct at compile time.<p>There are usually 2 types of query builders - SQL query builders, and DSL query builders. DSL ones are usually integrated with an ORM or something similar, and those are usually abstract enough to guarantee that the generated SQL and passed types are syntactically correct, even if invalid (ex. mentioning a column or a table that doesn&#x27;t exist). SQL query builders (at least the ones I&#x27;ve seen) don&#x27;t use an AST, as their purpose is to map methods to SQL chunks. They basically keep a list of different parts to assemble and then just build from those lists when generating the actual SQL. Some may provide object mapper capabilities, and in that case, some type checking may be performed. &quot;May&quot; in the sense that eg. a 14th century date is a valid date, but SQL Server will most certainly reject it, so in the end there are no &quot;compile time guarantees&quot; in this case.",web/mobile,,

You go on Instagram and see people living blissful lives of travel in gorgeous locales while talking about how affordable it is. That random dude who wrote a series of posts on some story-telling Reddit ends up getting it optioned by Hollywood and is now a major screenwriter. The sea shanty Tik-Tok&#x27;er is a major label recording artist.<p>Our culture&#x27;s positive values of egalitarianism and opportunity say that whatever you want your life to be can be, if only you work hard enough to get it.<p>The dark side of this is that many of us won&#x27;t. And, in particular, in many areas, the total number of brass rings is relatively fixed and we can&#x27;t all get them. A hundred years ago, most people didn&#x27;t even <i>think</i> of becoming an author. It was a rarefied activity done by people who went to college and moved to New York City. For more, authors felt like an Other. It&#x27;s not that their personal dreams of authorship were crushed by the lack of opportunity, it&#x27;s like they never thought to dream it in the first place, any more than people dream of being howler monkeys or velour sofas.<p>But today, media is more than happy to show us all possible dreams. Our social media aggregators filter out all of the lives you&#x27;re <i>likely</i> to lead and show you only the best ones.<p>So I think today many many more people <i>consider</i> and <i>try</i> to become authors than ever before. But the total amount of time spent reading isn&#x27;t growing enough to accommodate that. While some will find success (for however they choose to define that), the end result is probably a much greater number of dreams thwarted than attained.<p>I love this TED talk by Alain de Botton on success: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MtSE4rglxbY"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MtSE4rglxbY</a><p>He says:<p>&quot;It is probably as unlikely nowadays that you would become as rich and famous as Bill Gates as it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would exceed to the ranks of the French aristocracy.

She&#x27;s extremely low-functioning with only basic non-verbal communication (pulling me to the door means &quot;let&#x27;s go outside&quot;; pulling me to the kitchen means &quot;I&#x27;m hungry&quot;).

She has almost no instinct of self-preservation and a fascination with water, so will eagerly jump into a body of water if she has the chance; likewise when we go for a walk she doesn&#x27;t understand that she can&#x27;t just run out into traffic. Screaming and self-injury are constant and extreme.<p>Which is to say that I don&#x27;t think she and I have the same condition.

It may be appropriate to remove them if we can statically ensure they aren&#x27;t needed at runtime, in other words if we can prove that the condition tested for can never occur.<p>&gt; This is where the analysis done by GNATprove comes in. It can be used to demonstrate statically that none of these errors can ever occur at runtime. Specifically, GNATprove logically interprets the meaning of every instruction in the program. Using this interpretation, GNATprove generates a logical formula called a verification condition for each check that would otherwise be required by the Ada (and hence SPARK) language.<p>Additionally, in Ada&#x2F;SPARK, you can formally verify tasks (concurrency), too: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.adacore.com&#x2F;spark2014-docs&#x2F;html&#x2F;ug&#x2F;en&#x2F;source&#x2F;concurrency.html#preventing-data-races"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.adacore.com&#x2F;spark2014-docs&#x2F;html&#x2F;ug&#x2F;en&#x2F;source&#x2F;co...</a>.<p>Moreover:<p>&gt; SPARK builds on the strengths of Ada to provide even more guarantees statically rather than dynamically.  As summarized in the following table, Ada provides strict syntax and strong typing at compile time plus dynamic checking of run-time errors and program contracts.

7437,"&gt; They are policy decisions that kind of make sense for a device like a tablet or phone though. Even though you could technically allow installing a complete development toolchain on an iPad, I can&#x27;t imagine what the process would look like in practice. Download and install a complete *nix userland through the app store? Plus a compiler toolchain and each and every tool used in the build phase for your product? Who is going to maintain and distribute all these parts if the whole ecosystem is designed around the idea that apps are sandboxed and distributed through a curated app store? Imagine the customer support burden if you are the maintainer of some app that depends on external tools that can be used in a zillion different build&#x2F;deploy configurations.<p>I&#x27;ve got Termux running on my phone, complete with vim plugins, language server support, several compilers and all kinds of other tools. Combined with a bluetooth keyboard, it can be very useful in a pinch. It&#x27;ll stop working on Android 11 because of &quot;security concerns&quot;, but either thankfully or sadly, my phone has no stable Android 11 release yet. Everything is running inside a sandbox, I don&#x27;t even have root access, and the binaries are distributed through a normal Linux package manager. With the right software you can even run a normal GUI on it through VNC or Spice, although that&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t explored yet.<p>No need for other app developers to have any relation with Termux, that&#x27;s what the sandbox is for. On Android, you can theoretically implement a system for sharing binaries and virtual files quite easily if Termux would support it, but I haven&#x27;t seen such need myself.<p>These tools are maintained by volunteers and the Termux developer, and can be extended by adding repositories made by other people. So &quot;who is going to maintain and distribute all these parts&quot; comes down to the same question as &quot;who is maintaining and distributing all of these Debian packages&quot;: the developers who want to make the ecosystem and apps function.<p>Most users won&#x27;t use their phone or tablet like this, but I honestly don&#x27;t see why they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to if they wish to. Apple is selling a complete keyboard and display stand for iPads, so these devices are clearly being targeted for productive use. Yet Apple refuses to allow developers to be productive on these devices, because they don&#x27;t want competition for their crappy mobile browser engine.<p>As far as hardware is concerned, the touch screen, keyboard and OS are pretty much the only serious differences between the iPad and the Macbook Air. If you prefer a two-in-one tablet&#x2F;laptop combo (which quite a lot of people do), the iPad is the closest Apple product to fit the description, if it would allow users more software freedom.<p>I do see the advantage of the curated app store, but I don&#x27;t see the advantage of banning customers from not using said app store for the end user. You don&#x27;t _have_ to install any apps from outside the app store, you just get the option to do so if you wish. I don&#x27;t know any non-technical people who have installed apps from outside the Play Store, so it&#x27;s not like allowing any lifted restrictions will make the ecosystem collapse.<p>I have a hard time understanding why you would want a company to tell you what you can and cannot use a device for.

Even on desktop Sketch, Adobe, and Microsoft are going with subscriptions. (We’ll see how Affinity does. They charge a lot more for their apps and seem to be in a growth phase so I imagine their sales at the moment are fast enough to make up for the fact that each sale is only a one time source of revenue).<p>Honestly, Panic and Omni and other old school Mac developers really, really need to adapt to the modern era.

(And it does come up in the real world; you can often have Go functions that operate on io.Readers that are connected to the network, or are connected to disk files.  A profile that extends into the kernel can show you which case is slow.)<p>I&#x27;ve been consistently disappointed by Go&#x27;s mutex profiling.  It is kind of useful if you can synthesize the contention, but less useful if the contention isn&#x27;t obvious.  For my most recent contention debugging issue, I was very close to modifying the runtime (mostly sync.Mutex) to emit events that perf could sample on, and build a flame graph for cases like &quot;took the fast path on sync.Mutex&quot;.  What takes the fast path under synthetic load could easily take the slow path under different load, and that would let you identify the bottlenecks before they occur.  I ended up not needing it, so didn&#x27;t do it, but it&#x27;s interesting to me that other people have run into the case where the built-in profiles aren&#x27;t quite enough.  There are definitely a lot of improvements to be made here.<p>(Getting ahead of lock contention has come up a lot in my Go career.  When I was at Google, I had an application that computed metrics over hundreds of thousands of concurrent network streams.  I used the standard library for metrics, which synchronized on sync.RWMutex, and it was just too slow to synchronize millions of events per second.  This sort of bottleneck will be obvious to anyone, probably; you simply can&#x27;t block all metric-increments on reads every 15 seconds and expect to fully utilize use 96vCPUs that are trying to write ;)  No profile ever pointed me at the culprit in a straightforward manner; I had to dig into the time-per-assembly-instruction profile and noticed inordinate amount of time being spent in an instruction incidental to the implementation of sync.Mutex.  I ended up switching to atomic.AddInt64, which solved my problem.  I think the overhead of a write barrier is actually too heavy and wouldn&#x27;t do that today; I&#x27;d just maintain goroutine-local counters and synchronize them occasionally.

We think we’ll need over a million volunteers someday to support all 8 million low-income HS students in the US. However, at least during COVID-19, we found it really easy to recruit volunteers because everyone was looking for virtual opportunities. At one point we amassed a wait list of over 10K people who wanted to volunteer with us.<p>I think one thing we have going in our favor in the long run is that we designed the volunteer opportunity to be convenient enough that even busy professionals should be able to take part. Volunteers have complete control over their own schedule and how much time they want to work with students in any given week&#x2F;month&#x2F;year.<p>One study found that 50% of Americans say that they want to give back but can’t because of time and schedule constraints. About a third of Americans are college-educated and likely able to tutor at least one subject, so that puts us at about 50M potential volunteers just in the US who might be both qualified and interested in our volunteer opportunity.<p>Through corporate partnerships with big companies and potentially even clubs on college campuses, we’re hopeful we can recruit enough volunteers to meet student demand in perpetuity. And to address your point about recruiting for harder subjects… another thing we have in our favor is that the distribution of individuals qualified to help with different subjects matches up pretty well with the distribution of students needing help in different subjects. Our most popular subjects on the platform are actually lower-level math subjects like Algebra 1 and Geometry, and those are also the subjects volunteers are most likely to get certified in.",general,,

Or, maybe the companies I worked at really were the &quot;best&quot; ones for worker quality of life.<p>As for my own politics, I&#x27;m not so much pro-union as I am pro-worker cooperative. Unions today do a lot of things for their own benefit at the expense of the rest of society. I see it locally with the teachers union in my school district. It&#x27;s awful, they are bankrupting the school district and their demands are completely out of touch with reality. So I don&#x27;t think just having a union is the silver bullet here. Unions pit workers against management. In a hugely creative and cooperative venture like making a video game, that is a pretty big negative.<p>I would <i>love</i> to see more employee owned businesses. Unfortunately video games are hugely capital intensive and very risky. You need to be able to throw away tens of millions of dollars. Very unlike manufacturing where at least if your product fails, you still have a valuable factory. If your video game flops, you literally have $0 in assets to show for it.<p>So, we need to come up with different ways of financing capital and organizing labor so that everyone&#x27;s best interests are at heart. Very difficult problem to solve and capitalism isn&#x27;t very interested in solving it.

It means other more complicated indexing or looping approaches need to be used, and when showing code to coworkers (mostly mathematicians), they puzzle over this for a while before asking “why not just use i &gt;= 0”? It’s not just this case - doing index arithmetic in general is vastly complicated by the fact that it’s difficult to detect idx &lt; 0.<p>I think unsignedness on array indices is one of those places where the “make invalid states  unrepresentable” mantra has gone too far: yes it’s nice that theoretically the whole 64-bit index space is addressable from a byte array based at 0, but in reality -1 is just as stupid and invalid an array index as 2^64 - 1 for pretty much every use-case.

Why would you mention that something obviously false has been disproven?<p>Look, it&#x27;s not my fault you don&#x27;t know the origins of race science or what the claims were that your predecessors were making. If the origins of your theory are embarrassing to you, then... I mean, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you about that.<p>More recently, the modern wave of race science has been largely driven by people like Murray, who posited in the Bell Curve that the 10-15 point IQ gap is <i>primarily</i> genetic and highly heritable. Murray suggests that social interventions are unlikely to significantly lower that gap, and that instead we should focus on eugenics (he uses nicer language of course).<p>You and I have already disproven Murray&#x27;s theory in previous comments by noting that gaps decrease when race is hidden from hiring managers, and by noting that wage gaps persist in industries where success does not have a high correlation with intelligence. So we don&#x27;t need to rehash that theory, you&#x27;re already on board with me that Murray is wrong to say that the current IQ gap can be mostly explained by genetics. You&#x27;ve already softened that claim, and now you say that the current gap is <i>partially</i> explained by genetics.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s quite simply not what black means in common language.<p>Yes, it really is; the person on the street is not using ancestry tests to determine what percentage &quot;Black&quot; people are, the common denominator is skin color. Black communities do not have the uniform genetic background you&#x27;re assuming, and common metrics people on the street use to determine &quot;Blackness&quot; do not line up with ancestry.<p>This is broad scientific consensus, the position of the AAPA since the late 90s can be summed up as: &quot;Race does not provide an accurate representation of human biological variation. It was never accurate in the past, and it remains inaccurate when referencing contemporary human populations. [...] Notably, variants are not distributed across our species in a manner that maps clearly onto socially-recognized racial groups.&quot;[0] This is the general consensus of people who are actually studying genetics and anthropology in the real world.<p>And in fact, when you actually go over the studies even from race scientists, what you find is that in the majority of cases the racial phenotype <i>even they</i> use to categorize their subjects also lines up with the AAPA&#x27;s view. You know how the majority of these race science studies determine who is and isn&#x27;t Black? Skin color and heckin <i>self-reporting</i> of racial identity. So it&#x27;s just pure revisionism to claim that &quot;actually, we meant something different by Black the entire time&quot;.<p>If you are trying to make a claim here based on purely percentage of African American heritage, then you need to throw a lot of existing race research out and start over, and that includes books like the Bell Curve which were almost entirely based on metrics like self reporting and not actual measurements of ancestry.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s consistent with what I wrote. Again, you seem to be intentionally misunderstanding me.<p>My deep apologies. Just to make sure I understand, when you said that &quot;another possibility is their shared lack of recent Neanderthal DNA&quot;, what you actually meant was that African Americans <i>do</i> have recent Neanderthal DNA?<p>And not to keep harping on this, but &quot;shared&quot; is putting in a lot of work here, because as I keep mentioning, Black populations do not have the genetic uniformity you claim.<p>&gt; Oh. didn&#x27;t know that. Reference?<p>Take a look at stats released from companies like 23AndMe and Ancestry. Our best guess is that the average African-American genome is about 20-30% European (although we&#x27;ve only recently started really measuring this, so those numbers might change over time). That range can vary drastically as well, it&#x27;s not that all Black people are uniformly 25% European, they might be close to 50%, or as low as 10%. I&#x27;m not sure what kind of reference you&#x27;re looking for with that, but there have been a couple of press releases and cooperative studies using 23andme data that go into detail on their findings.[1]<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that the Black IQ gap is consistent across demographics and geographic regions in the US, which... again, leads us to question why we&#x27;re not seeing more variation, even in studies from people who believe in scientific racism -- because the actual racial makeup of those groups is <i>not</i> consistent across geography.<p>----<p>&gt; still no clear evidence against &quot;Blacks are genetically predisposed to being poor.&quot;. So I assume it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>And still no clear evidence that Conservatives are genetically predisposed to being lower education&#x2F;poorer than the average population, so I assume that evidence doesn&#x27;t exist either.<p>I will make you understand how burden of proof works. If you believe that it&#x27;s my job to disprove that Black IQ gaps are genetic, then I want you to disprove to me that rural&#x2F;urban Conservative&#x2F;Liberal IQ and wage gaps are genetic -- or I want you to explain to me why you think that theory shouldn&#x27;t be factored into every discussion about university bias, voting rights, and industry discrimination against Conservatives.<p>And of course, I&#x27;m still waiting for a response to the below quote:<p>&gt; So what&#x27;s your objection to the equality movement and racial activism? It sounds like you agree there are environmental and cultural factors that suppress Black outcomes, so it should be easy to get on board with eliminating those factors. We can have a debate about genetics after we&#x27;ve eliminated the external non-genetic factors that you agree exist.<p>You say that you agree with me that a purely biological difference, even if it does exist, is not enough on its own to explain the gap we see. So you should be fine with progressive policies that attempt to eliminate the non-heritable reasons for inequality.<p>----<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hysanth.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;position-statements&#x2F;aapa-statement-race-and-racism-2019&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hysanth.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;position-statements&#x2F;aapa-statement...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;genetic-study-reveal...</a>",general,,

8206,"I can give you half an answer and speculation on the other half.<p>Given that radioisotopes decay with a halflife pattern, I would expect that you&#x27;d see a 16.6% drop in capacity every 23 years. So something like:<p><pre><code>    1977: 100% (470 W)
    2000: 83.4% (392 W)
    2023: 69.6% (327 W)
</code></pre>
To get a full answer, you&#x27;d need to know how the thermocouples degrade. Under the (completely unsubstantiated) assumption that they degrade linearly, that&#x27;s about a 20% efficiency degradation per 23 years:<p><pre><code>    1977: 100% isotope * 100% coupling efficiency -&gt; 470 W (100% usable power)
    2000: 83.4% isotope * 80% coupling efficiency -&gt; 314 W (67% usable power)
    2023: 69.6% isotope * 60% coupling efficiency -&gt; 196 W (41% usable power)

8364,"&gt; I imagine using canvas gave them a lot more flexibility in addition to being more performant.<p>I&#x27;m perplexed because I <i>don&#x27;t</i> expect canvas rendering to be faster - or necessarily more flexible - because the web is document-first: HTML and CSS were&#x2F;are all built-around describing and styling <i>textual content</i>, and computer program source code files are invariably all textual content files. So while browsers all have heavily-optimized fast-paths written in native code for rendering the DOM to the screen with the full flexibility of all of CSS&#x27;s styling features - so applications switching to canvas rendering will first have to contend with needing to reimplement at least the subset of CSS that they&#x27;re using for their editor - and it has to run as JavaScript (or WASM?) - and I just don&#x27;t understand how that could possibly be faster than letting the DOM do its thing.<p>I appreciate that DOM+CSS rendering is not designed-around monospaced text editing or with specific support for typical text-editor and IDE features which do indeed throw a wrench into the works[1], but I think a much better approach would be to carve-out the cases where the current DOM and rendering model is insufficient or inappropriate for those specific applications&#x27; purposes and find a way to solve those problems without resorting to canvas rendering.<p>That said, is this change because Google wants to use Flutter for a single codebase for Google Docs that would work across iOS, Android, and the web? Flutter does have a HTML+DOM+CSS rendering mode, but it&#x27;s horrible (literally thousands of empty &lt;div&gt; elements in their hello-world example...)<p>[1] e.g. a HTML&#x2F;DOM document is strictly an unidirectional acyclic tree structure, and CSS selectors are also strictly forwards-only (e.g. you cannot have a HTML element that spans other elements, you cannot isolate individual text characters, you cannot select a descendant element to style based on its subsequent siblings, or ancestor&#x27;s subsequent siblings), and how the render-state of a document is also strictly derived from the DOM and so does not allow for any feedback loops unless you start to use scripts, which means you can&#x27;t select elements to style based on their computed styles (unlike, for example, WPF+XAML, where you can bind any property to another property - something I think XAML implements horribly...), and I appreciate this makes certain kinds of UI&#x2F;UX work difficult (if not impossible in some cases), but in the use-case of an editor I just don&#x27;t see these as being show-stopper issues.",web/mobile,,

I&#x27;ve had to solve this on almost every web app I&#x27;ve worked on.<p>I&#x27;ve just gone though your `example.csv`, and have this feedback:<p>- the (row) &quot;Remove&quot; action seemed like data column to me, because it is placed adjacent to the data.  I would separate the actions completely from the data.  I&#x27;d probably avoid the &quot;X&quot; within the column, as again, it looks like data.  Admittedly, users probably know the content of the CSV they are uploading, so this might not be too big a concern.  But the UX&#x2F;semantics of styling the &quot;actions&quot; the same as &quot;data&quot; seems like it will lead to confusion.  At the moment, the only action is &quot;Remove&quot;, so I might drop the Remove &quot;column&quot;, just put a button labelled &quot;Remove&quot;; after all, the &quot;X&quot; is already a &quot;button&quot; (as a link).  That said, bulk actions a chore to implement and so I suspect getting this working nicely will probably be a big draw for your target market.  Whether it&#x27;s checkbox boxes with a single select drop down to apply an &quot;action&quot;, or a select drop down on each row (painful UX, I&#x27;d think).  Hopefully you already have a revision on your roadmap.<p>- The wording &quot;File has 1 invalid rows. Please resolve the errors before uploading.&quot; is occurring after the user has already uploaded the CSV, so I think it should be adjusted.  At this point in the workflow, I&#x27;d probably stop referring to &quot;File&quot; (the user is only concerned with the data at this point).  I&#x27;d suggest more succinct wording, perhaps: &quot;1 invalid row must be resolve before continuing.&quot;; or &quot;...before you may continue.&quot;, if you prefer using the second person in the app messages.<p>- The full screen modal for a small number of rows forces the user to hunt for the buttons and mouse a far distance.  I realize for most data, the modal is <i>likely</i> to be the entire screen (and multi-page), but nevertheless, I would probably make the modal shrink to the data.  As a consideration for your market: I&#x27;ve written apps which use CSV for only ~25 rows, and I would still consider using this because the user interaction for sanity and clean-up was still code I would&#x27;ve prefer to skip writing.<p>- I would increase the number of rows permitted at the lower tiers.  Maybe you are analyzing the imports and have a lot of information about the pricing breakpoints and segmentation, but my hunch would be that fewer imports with more rows might entice people.  I can think of apps which might have only 5 or 10 imports per month, but need more than 50K rows per import, but it&#x27;s a pretty big jump to Basic, so you might miss those customers.<p>- I would make the corrected&#x2F;edited CSV available for download (by the customer) at the end of the import.  If anyone needs to re-import, it will surely be annoying to re-correct it during import; or even to remember all the corrections they made during import and go back and correct their original spreadsheet (or other data source).<p>- Would be nice to see PostgreSQL on your destination roadmap :-)<p>Again, this seems like a really good idea to me.

They even have the best test-data of any company. But they choose to side-step some of these problems by introducing another, completely new technology and then a small team of people goes on to hack something useable using this technology as if they were a small startup.
The problem is, Google is basically a collection of teams with very different focus points. Some are paid to develop new technology no matter if they want it for a specific product. Other people are paid to &quot;improve&quot; an existing product, e.g. Google Docs and have to use what is available.

It is probably less by now, but I don&#x27;t use it. You also have the option to bake everything into a single file, much like how Rust does it.<p>So yeah, I wish more people would play with .Net Core and it&#x27;s tooling a bit, it&#x27;s bloody great at moment.

Calling the the dotnet build tools from my own console apps is a no brainer. My build tools can then be called by other processes in linux like any other cli app, or if I build them as asp.net projects, a simple middleware to intercept calls from nginx to trigger workflows remotely... easy peasy.

You can&#x27;t really do much more than that without moving to a monocoque carbon frame to offset the weight, because the batteries are too dense. Commercial trucks have total weight limits, but they also have per-axle weight limits. If you are too heavy on a single axle, you&#x27;re illegal.<p>And while 500kWh batteries, are awesome and the perfect use case for local delivery, they won&#x27;t cut it for OTR trucking. You need 700 mi of range at an absolute minimum for singles, ~2000mi for doubles. The weight of a 700 mile battery is a non-starter. Tesla&#x27;s largest battery pack that they&#x27;re even considering selling has a 500 mi range.<p>There is a reason Tesla quotes kWh&#x2F;mile, and not kWh&#x2F;lb-mi (cargo, not GVW).

But Covid-19 vaccines have predictably prevented illness, and they are a far safer bet, experts said.<p>Vaccines for some pathogens, like pneumococcal bacteria, induce better immunity than the natural infection does. Early evidence suggests that the Covid-19 vaccines may fall into this category. Volunteers who received the Moderna shot had more antibodies — one marker of immune response — in their blood than did people who had been sick with Covid-19.<p>In other cases, however, a natural infection is more powerful than a vaccine. For example, having mumps — which can, in rare cases, cause fertility problems in men — generates lifelong immunity, but some people who have received one or two doses of the vaccine still get the disease.</i><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;05&#x2F;health&#x2F;covid-natural-immunity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;05&#x2F;health&#x2F;covid-natural-immu...</a><p>I am also not an expert, so my first link is to someone who is (an immunologist).

Alpine simplicity would makes sense after then.<p>Otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend installing Alpine in a VM and play with it for a week. On a lower level, alpine-base[1], alpha-baselayout[2], and alpine-conf[3] might be a point of interest. alpine-conf contains several scripts for bootstrapping the entire system (e.g. setup-disk&#x2F;setup-bootable&#x2F;update-kernel).

6495,"Sure!<p>The title was unique to my business but in practice I was a ‘Senior’ position. I joined a company that had been part of the UK civil service but which had been privatised before I joined. The part I belonged to conducted advice-side &#x2F; customer-friend work as opposed to supply-side &#x2F; product-development. So in effect I was an independent technical consultant deployed into UK Govt customer organisations (in Defence) to support their activities, which included the stuff I mentioned before (requirements definition, business case development, etc). I did this for approx. 10 years, starting very technically focussed (e.g. helping to draft tech sections of Invitations To Tender or contributing to standards development) but gradually looking at business &#x2F; organisational issues (e.g. can we restructure this organisation to reduce commercial and technical barriers to efficiency? &#x2F; what research do we need to do to conduct to de-risk this new simulation technology?). I became reasonably well known in the customer community and, crucially, was trusted as a friendly techie rather than a commercial ‘suit’.<p>The plus side to this was getting superb levels of customer access and some experiences not available to most civilians. Because I had been around for years the customers saw me as someone who actually understood their domain and their problems. I knew their acronyms and understood their business processes, more so than some of them did (especially customers who were new in role).<p>The downside was that from the perspective of my parent company, I had effectively ‘gone native’ with the customers (although was still useful because I generated revenue and demonstrated the competence of my company). I had to be commercially fire-walled away from the product side of the company so that the customers still trusted me. This limited my career development – partly because I couldn’t be involved in high-profile bids and delivery projects that attracted C-suite attention. As an example, although my salary increased okay, I found it very hard to gain evidence (e.g. third party feedback) that would support a grade rise. As it was, I didn’t mind too much (this was the latter end of my career) but had I been younger it would have been frustrating.",web/mobile,,

6542,"These are two completely different statistics: 1) last year, new releases sold poorly, perhaps unexpectedly (NYT article&#x27;s claim); 2) last year, a relatively small portion of <i>all currently released titles</i> sold a lot of books, and most titles sold few books (linked article&#x27;s data).<p>Pulling from the central table, last year: one title sold over 1 million copies; ten titles sold a collective 5-10 million copies; 267 titles sold a collective 26-133 million copies; 7,294 titles sold a collective 70-700 million copies; and 2.6 million titles sold between 0 and 2.6 BILLION copies. My guess is that last number is way closer to zero than 2.6 billion, so I&#x27;ll exclude it when I say: the table the author cites shows that last year sold 100-840 million copies. Digital copies!

My personal information is never shared or stored in a big bank computer system.”<p>&gt;“Employees of defendant [U.S. Private Vaults] would conduct counter surveillance of the neighborhood and warn customers when they observed law enforcement,” the indictment said.

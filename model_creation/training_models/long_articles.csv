There&#x27;s a reason no major distro beyond the Fedora line that enables it by default, including the one I work one; it almost invariably frustrates users, has incomplete support for the workflows they use, and so they turn it off anyway. I literally turned off SELinux on my new ARM64 Fedora machine last week, because it prevented me from installing a third party binary (which I am a developer of.)

To this end, we decided to open source our work and make it completely free to self-host.

759,"Simpler and monolith has it&#x27;s place, but I see it as impossible for any &quot;simple&quot; solution to ever gain enough mindshare to win. A lot of people suggesting monoliths &amp; hosted services, but they are never going to have the community, the presence of something like Kubernetes, which unites people, which people collaborate over, in the same way we all got to learn &amp; experience &amp; co-develop for Docker. The question posted somewhat gets it wrong, &quot;Kubernetes became a thing after Docker became a thing (and so on,&quot; implies that they&#x27;re different things, that tech is about different things, but in many ways Kubernetes is a natural extension &amp; outgrowth, it is a part of the Docker scene, &amp; has continuity with it.<p>Kubernetes is a thing now, but it&#x27;s patterns are still underspoken of, underpracticed, underdeployed to the rest of the software world. We will get better at being like Kubernetes, for great benefit. Folks learning how control-loops are advantageous, and learning to use universal API Servers for all their systems will continue to drive not just Kubernetes, but the patterns underlying Kubernetes further into our applications &amp; services &amp; technologies. Tech like KCP[1] is an early indicator of this interest, in using the soul of kubernetes if not it&#x27;s specific machinery, by creating an independent, non-Kubernetes, but Kubernetes compatible API Server. Having universal storage, having autonomic system control are huge advantages when system building, and gaining those benefits is fairly easy, with or without Kubernetes itself.<p>I&#x27;m hoping we see a DIY cloud&#x27;ing become more of a thing. Leaving everything in the hands of hyperscalers is a puzzling and hard to imagine state of affairs, given the hardware nirvana we&#x27;ve experienced in the past two plus decades. Kubernetes is the first viable multi-system operational paradigm, the first diy-able cloud we have, and it&#x27;s shocking it took that long, but smaller practitioners getting good at converting their sea of individual boxes into something more resembling the Single System Image dreams of old, albeit through a highly indirect Kubernetes-ish route, is a decade or decades long quest we seemingly just started in to a couple years ago.<p>I&#x27;m hoping eventually ubiquotous and pervasive computing starts to dovetail with this world, that we start to have better view &amp; visibility of all the computing resources around us, via standardized, well known interfaces. Rather than the hodgepodge of manufacturer controlled, invisible, un-debuggable overlay networks that alas, constitute the vast majority of the use of the internet these days. Alas the news  there is never good, the new Matter standard is, like Thread, inaccessible, unviewable; consumers are expected to remain dumb, ignorant, unaware of how any of it works, merely thankful for whatever magic they receive[2][3]. But as a home-cloud, as the manor re-establishes computing as base &amp; competency for itself (#ManorCompute), &amp; as good projects like WebThings[4] or whatever takes it&#x27;s place light the darkened damp corridors only robots patrolled, I hope for a reawakening, hope a silent majority becomes more real &amp; known, hope the fed up, sick of this shit, disgusted with remote-service-based technology world starts to manifest &amp; apply real pressure to emerge a healthy, pro-human, pro-user ubiquotous &amp; pervasive computing that gives us an honest shake, that shows what it is, that integrates into our personal home clouds.<p>I think there&#x27;s a huge pent up demand &amp; desire for flow-based&#x2F;evented systems, for Yahoo Pipes, for Node-RED[5]. The paradigm needs help, I think there&#x27;s too many missing pieces for something like Node-RED to be the one, but re-emerging user-control, giving us ALL flexible means to compute, is key. Exposing &amp; embracing some level of technical literacy is something people want, but no one knows how to articulate it or what they want. We&#x27;re mired in a &quot;faster horses&quot; stage, and it&#x27;s fundamentally incorrect.<p>Last, I have huge hopes for the web. There are incredibly awesome advances being made in the range of peripherals, devices, capabilities the web supports. The web can do so much more. We&#x27;re barely beginning to use the cutting edge ServiceWorkers, barely beginning to use Custom Elements (&quot;WebComponenets&quot;), and these aren&#x27;t even that new any more. These are fundamentally revolutionary technologies. Things like File System Access just came back on the scene after over a decade of going nowhere. Secondary screen working group is tying together multiple systems in interesting ways. There&#x27;s a lot of high-tower shit, in WebAssembly (especially when Interface Bindings starts to allow real interop with JS), in TypeScript, but to me, I think rather than just building up up up there&#x27;s some very real re-assessments we ought to be making about how and what we build. Trying to make self-documenting machines, trying to make computing visible, these aren&#x27;t concerns of industrial computing, but they are socially invaluable advances that have been somewhat on hold in the age of Pax React-us, and we&#x27;re well over half a decade in &amp; while there&#x27;s endless areas to learn about, improve, get better at in this highly industrialized toolset, I want to think there are some slumbering appetites, some desires to re-assess. I&#x27;m a bit afraid&#x2F;scared of WebAssembly being a huge tower-of-babel time-sink&#x2F;re-industrializing-focus that distracts from the need for a new vision quest, but I have hope too, I see the yearning. Albeit often expressed in lo-fi counter-culture, which to me is a distraction &amp; avoidance, rather than the socially empowering act that has been a quiet part of the web&#x27;s promise[6].<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kcp-dev&#x2F;kcp"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kcp-dev&#x2F;kcp</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staceyoniot.com&#x2F;project-chip-becomes-matter&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staceyoniot.com&#x2F;project-chip-becomes-matter&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27123944"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27123944</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webthings.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webthings.io&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodered.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodered.org&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webdevlaw.uk&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;why-generation-x-will-save-the-web&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webdevlaw.uk&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;why-generation-x-will-save-t...</a>",web/mobile,,devops/OS

The manufacturers hated it because (a) their existence relied on the good will of this corporate behemoth, and (b) supplying so much product to the discounter meant less was available around the country for retail shops, which is essential to building brand loyalty.  When Leegin happened, the discounter begrudgingly admitted that they would be forced to raise prices. But not before buying out a few accessory manufacturers.<p>While not as popular as simply discounting cigars, it sorta worked for them. They would sell a box of cigars at the lowest price that they could and then include a free humidor to store them in.

This brand conglomerate is way more blatantly of the form of “lets try to take a pile of money, and turn it into a bigger pile of money”.. of course they need $160M in funding, it is a fund. That money will go chiefly to buy companies, not into massive scale.<p>Not many entrepreneurs start out hoping to engage in raw capitalism, guided purely by returns.  YC seemed like a place that catered to that dream of building something for yourself.  Maybe that was never true, and I just had stars in my eyes.  Maybe there’s no longer those low hanging fruits and everything’s become harder.  But this seems almost of a betrayal of that original dream, only showing that YC is the same as everyone else in our capitalistic society.",general,,general

If the goal is to produce original research, is such a person likely to be capable of priding truly original work?

13,"I analyzed about 200 #BuildInPublic twitter accounts, collected the best practices of #BuildingInPublic and grouped them into categories. Hope you find it useful.<p>1)Tell how you cope with struggles
Glossy stories repel. And do you remember at least one popular film without overcoming problems and difficulties? Great tool for building trust, and relationships.
 2)Tell what has changed through experience
Creating something creates a new experience that changes us and the way we work, it&#x27;s a great thing to share.
3) Engage your readers in the process
Interactivity is a great opportunity to captivate readers.
4) Ask
Here we are not talking about questions to engage the audience, but to find expertise for your project - involve in the product, not in the tweet.
5) Shine a light on what&#x27;s behind the scene
Most of the work on the product is not visible to customers, but this does not mean that it should not be shown.
6) Story of today
Life is not always a routine, unusual events or experiments are a great opportunity to share them
7) Tell how you feel
Tell about your feelings about creating something.Creation is always a gamut of emotions.
8) Breakdown metrics&#x2F;milestone
Dry numbers are not catchy, but how you achieved this is a completely different story.
9) Uncover the value of a new feature
Do not tell what you did, tell what it will give to the user
10)Harsh truth
Moving forward, we often see and feel the hidden side.#BuildinPublic is a great opportunity to show it. Honesty wins.
11)Show your toolbox
Thor has a hammer, Captain America has a shield, but what do you have?
12) We all are people
We all have ups and downs. This is completely normal and part of the creation of any product

Then you have the observers who view the operation. For replication, depending on the era that the opera was created and first rendered the replication and want to re-view it or expand viewership the adding more observers would be word to mouth. In a modern era that moment of orchestration could be captured on video and marketed online. This opens even MORE human interaction and duration because the humans over time moved technology to the point where the quality of sampling rate has moved from poor audio to obscenely realistic video. Then there are people who may have heard it at a lower sample rate and prefer it vs new sampling rates which are incidental data inputs in and of themselves.  And as people die new generations pick up positions in the orchestration the decisions they chose, the biological improvements for tone generations one person may have, or a more expressive actor may impact the observers more than a previous one.

It may help me convince more companies to offer their roles on a 4 day work week - there are huge benefits for both employers and employees imo.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;philostar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1393199633543966723",web/mobile,,job/career
538,"so the key question here is what a &quot;mid-level&quot; engineer can do for your company early.  An engineer with 5 years of experience at FAANG will easily make ~200-250k, competitive scaling startups and public companies will compensate equivalently withing ~30% in liquid compensation.<p>If that engineer instead works for 100k and takes 100k in illiquid equity which may or may not be worth something in 10 years, they are losing well over a million dollars in opportunity. Given that 5 more years at a top-tier firm would double their compensation they could easily be giving up multiple millions.  To be employee #5-50 this individual should be getting an equity option that would reasonably be worth millions in an exit scenario for it to make sense.<p>Most startups simply aren&#x27;t competitive for this mid-level engineer given current compensation practices.  Which leads to a sub-selection of talent for those who for various reasons aren&#x27;t willing or able to work at a firm willing to pay that level of compensation.  Bear in mind, if the engineer had liquid equity from a public corporation they would be able to leave equity in hand after 4 years.<p>Whether this is a problem or not is an interesting question for startup CEOs. Generally I&#x27;ve found success in software is more closely correlated to the quality of employees than the quantity, and historically companies with generous compensation practices seem to be the successful ones.",job/career,,job/career
755,I can and have done so for a period of 7 years. The problem is that developers want to work for fancy big box companies with big salaries and it&#x27;s exactly those type of companies that aren&#x27;t going to allow you to do this. You have to find a small to medium sized business if you want flexible hours. If you do get an interview with such a business make sure it&#x27;s clear as part of your contract you only plan on working 32 hours a week. After a while they may try to cajole you into working more hours and you will need to stand your ground.,web/mobile,,job/career

It&#x27;s summer now, so I&#x27;m happy to spend more time with friends and family.<p>And while we&#x27;re talking about working less, another thing that&#x27;s interesting I think is &quot;4-day work weeks&quot;.

The first two at least made an attempt to give you a reason for rejection, the last one is just so infuriating. &quot;We are only looking for full-time employees&quot; as a response basically just says &quot;Go away, don&#x27;t waste my time&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ll say though, from the perspective of the company, almost no company is ever going to receive a cold call&#x2F;email from you and say, hey, this suggestion sounds good, let&#x27;s change our entire company culture based on this one random person&#x27;s opinion. If this movement indeed gets traction, it&#x27;ll take companies lots of time to change. It&#x27;s similar to remote work (before the pandemic).

44,"Hi everyone! My name’s Aly, and I’m the founder of UPchieve (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upchieve.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upchieve.org</a>). I’m here with UPchieve’s CTO, Dave (thedevelopnik). We’re an edtech nonprofit that provides free, 24&#x2F;7 online tutoring to low-income high school students.<p>The idea for UPchieve was based on my own personal experience as a low-income student. I was raised by a single mom who was an immigrant to the US and often couldn’t help me with schoolwork and applying to college. So I went to a community college, and from there it took me 6 years to transfer to and graduate from a 4-year university.<p>College is not the only way for a low-income student to achieve upward mobility, but research shows it’s one of the most reliable. That was the story for me, too. Transferring to Penn helped me get a job on the trading floor at J.P. Morgan, where I immediately made 3x as much as my mom straight out of college.<p>I soon began looking for ways to give back and help other students like me get to college. Volunteering as a math tutor seemed like a great choice because I had tutored my way through HS and college and knew a lot about it, but I couldn’t find any existing volunteer opportunities that fit with my work schedule.<p>That’s when I first came up with the idea for UPchieve: an open source platform that could meet the needs of both younger-student-me (who needed help with schoolwork and college apps, often late at night in my home) and older-volunteer-me (who needed a flexible and convenient way to give back). Students can use UPchieve 24&#x2F;7 to request and get paired with a live tutor in 5 mins, and volunteers select their availability and then wait for a text notifying them that a student needs their help. You can see a demo of both the student and volunteer side of the platform here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SufRUje0XiM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SufRUje0XiM</a><p>Over the next two years, I realized that many other people cared about what I was doing and wanted to volunteer to help build the platform and tutor students. I also learned more about the state of education in the US and discovered that the gap in college completion rates between low- and high-income students hadn’t changed at all in 10+ years! This led me to grow more and more passionate about both the need for and potential of a platform like UPchieve. In 2018, I finally quit my job at J.P. Morgan to work on UPchieve full-time, with the new goal of scaling free tutoring to all low-income HS students across the US.<p>UPchieve is completely free for eligible students, and it only costs us $10 to give one student an entire year of unlimited academic support. For reference: online tutoring companies charge students $35 per hour on average. Other existing nonprofit tutoring models are prohibitively expensive and difficult to scale, due to factors like 1) cost of paid tutors, 2) in-person delivery, and 3) long-term commitments required of students and tutors.<p>We’re also working to become 100% self-sustaining (i.e., not dependent on donations). Companies like Verizon and Goldman Sachs pay us to provide virtual volunteer opportunities to their employees. Many big companies have budgets set aside specifically for volunteer opportunities because studies have found that employees who volunteer are more likely to stay at the company.<p>So far, we’ve helped more than 7,000 students and matched more than 30K on-demand requests for tutoring. My favorite part of my job has been reading the hundreds of comments we get from students each month, telling us how we’re helping them kick ass in their classes and that they can’t imagine life without us. It’s literally the best feeling ever. You can see some of my favorite student feedback here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1w3nqHSNiP-2270_Qxjvy367oRAU9Cn03gSJh7dGT5Lw&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1w3nqHSNiP-2270_Qxjvy...</a><p>If you like what we’re doing and want to help, please consider signing up to volunteer—we especially need more statistics, calculus, and physics tutors!

301,"Hi there,<p>I&#x27;m new to HN, so please bear with me here... coming from Slashdot (remember that?) and Stack, I found HN&#x27;s discussions to be incredibly refreshing, a mixture of fascinating submissions and intelligent commentary. Reminds me of the good ol&#x27; days of the internet, especially compared to the post-apocalyptic wasteland that reddit has become.<p>That said, I also find HN&#x27;s UX&#x2F;UI pretty difficult to use. It&#x27;s hard to see which stories have the most upvotes, for example, besides a tiny gray vote count under each story. There are no topic or time period filters. Inside the comments, there&#x27;s no way to sort them (hotness, newness, top) or collapse them (either individual threads, or the whole chain to the top replies).<p>Now, none of those are dealbreakers, obviously, and I would never want to see HN turn into the acidic glop that reddit is now, with a bunch of meaningless icons and colors everywhere, like MySpace all over again.

26,"Jess and Jo here, and we&#x27;re excited to share Ditto with you all (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dittowords.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dittowords.com</a>). Ditto is a way to manage product copy–or the text found on user interfaces–all the way from design to development. Think of a headless CMS but with the text from your design files.<p>We think product copy is one of the highest ROI aspects of product development today, but also one of the most overlooked. Even more so than the visuals, the text users read is critical to shaping their understanding of how things work. Copy often gets coupled as a part of design or neglected as hard-coded strings, even though it&#x27;s touched by everyone from design to legal to marketing to engineering. Lack of tooling specifically for copy means it often gets copy-pasted between a patchwork of tools intended for other use cases.<p>Jo and I have been on teams at both small startups and tech giants, and at every place we&#x27;ve seen product copy being written ad-hoc and scattered across mockups, docs, sheets, and tickets. The back and forth required just to fix a simple typo in production often included a backlogged ticket, several Slack conversations, and a ton of wasted engineering time better spent on building.<p>The two of us were fascinated by this problem–one that impacted the day-to-day of so many roles across a company but was rarely addressed. We decided to start working on it part-time while still in grad school and put together a simple landing page describing a tool that componentized product text. The response we got–emails from designers and developers from Salesforce to Square asking for a tool that didn’t yet exist–made us realize we had to pursue it full-time.<p>At its core, we wanted to build a way to treat product text as a system, with the ability to componentize text for reuse (just as we have components for development or design). We spent the last year building out and iterating on Ditto, deciding first to tackle how copy was managed between design files and content writers with our web-app and Figma integration.<p>However, our intent from day one has been to build a single source of truth from end to end, and have text from Ditto integrate into development. Initially, we took a stab at integrating into development by building a Github app that created pull requests for copy edits made in Ditto. This somewhat did the job (democratizing access to making text edits in development), but we saw users struggle with the maintenance it required. We realized it was a piecemeal solution to a system-level problem: Product text and “microcopy” (think text on buttons, error messages, etc.) has context, structure, and hierarchy just like any other content. Maintaining product copy as scattered, hard-coded strings, however, stripped it of its surrounding context.<p>We decided instead to build out an API (with a companion CLI and React SDK) so that Ditto could function similarly to a headless CMS and sync text from design all the way to production. The API&#x2F;CLI fetches up-to-date product copy from Ditto (and the designs) into local directories as structured JSONs with unique IDs for text and text groups. As a locally hosted and updated JSON, you always own your copy, can see copy diffs on commits, and won&#x27;t have to worry about latency (we&#x27;re not a CDN).<p>To check it out (with a quick 3 min video of me talking through the features), you can go to: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dittowords.com&#x2F;developers"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dittowords.com&#x2F;developers</a>.

We anticipate that the HN community has members, teammates, or friends that work on product teams, whether as developers, designers, product managers, legal or other roles that touch copy. We’d love to hear how your team currently manages copy — and most importantly your feedback.

I didn&#x27;t say prevent the volume of people from participating. Rather, incorporate a credentialing system so that maybe your fresh grad or boot-camper isn’t working 18hr days on standing up core infrastructure without the experience to push back against manipulative management or ridiculous client timelines. Prioritizing security will only happen if all engineers require it (otherwise you’d be undercut by someone who doesn&#x27;t care). <i>That’s</i> why you need governance. We all have to be on the same page about security and reliability and it just happens that not everyone is equally qualified to <i>do security</i> or has the edge to build really reliable systems.

Healthcare credentials exist to prevent damage to human life.

64,"This isn&#x27;t an attestation of personhood. This is attestation of access to a hardware module with certain properties. These are very different things. Obnoxiously different. Do any of the listed manufacturers implement any sort of rate limiting? If not, then it would be quite easy to set up a farm of yubikeys, and solve captchas for an arbitrarily low rate.<p>Also, what is the cost of a single one of these keys? If it&#x27;s relatively high (say, $50 each), then this would keep out a large portion of the 4 billion people that cloudflare claims to be seeking to help. If relatively low, then it would enable a farm to be run quite cheaply, even with aggressive rate limiting on each key.<p>So this does not at all prove personhood, it proves access to money. In that sense, it is nearly identical to a proof of work system. The parallels are actually quite amusing.

A very small minority of users behave in ways that are suspect, such as by rejecting cookies, resetting their browsing history, or using tor. These are the users that face frequent captchas.

Ditto is a way to manage product copy—or the text found on user interfaces—all the way from design to development. Think of a headless CMS but with the text from your design files.<p>We think product copy is one of the highest ROI aspects of product development today, but also one of the most overlooked. Even more so than the visuals, the text users read is critical to shaping their understanding of how things work. Copy often gets coupled as a part of design or neglected as hard-coded strings, even though it&#x27;s touched by everyone from design to legal to marketing to engineering. Lack of tooling specifically for copy means it often gets copy-pasted between a patchwork of tools intended for other use cases.<p>Jo and I have been on teams at both small startups and tech giants, and at every place we&#x27;ve seen product copy being written ad-hoc and scattered across mockups, docs, sheets, and tickets. The back and forth required just to fix a simple typo in production often included a backlogged ticket, several Slack conversations, and a ton of wasted engineering time better spent on building.<p>The two of us were fascinated by this problem—one that impacted the day-to-day of so many roles across a company but was rarely addressed. We decided to start working on it part-time while still in grad school and put together a simple landing page describing a tool that componentized product text. The response we got—emails from designers and developers from Salesforce to Square asking for a tool that didn’t yet exist—made us realize we had to pursue it full-time.<p>At its core, we wanted to build a way to treat product text as a system, with the ability to componentize text for reuse (just as we have components for development or design). We spent the last year building out and iterating on Ditto, deciding first to tackle how copy was managed between design files and content writers with our web-app and Figma integration.<p>However, our intent from day one has been to build a single source of truth from end to end, and have text from Ditto integrate into development. Initially, we took a stab at integrating into development by building a Github app that created pull requests for copy edits made in Ditto. This somewhat did the job (democratizing access to making text edits in development), but we saw users struggle with the maintenance it required. We realized it was a piecemeal solution to a system-level problem: Product text and “microcopy” (think text on buttons, error messages, etc.) has context, structure, and hierarchy just like any other content. Maintaining product copy as scattered, hard-coded strings, however, stripped it of its surrounding context.<p>We decided instead to build out an API (with a companion CLI and React SDK) so that Ditto could function similarly to a headless CMS and sync text from design all the way to production. The API&#x2F;CLI fetches up-to-date product copy from Ditto (and the designs) into local directories as structured JSONs with unique IDs for text and text groups. As a locally hosted and updated JSON, you always own your copy, can see copy diffs on commits, and won&#x27;t have to worry about latency (we&#x27;re not a CDN).<p>To check it out (with a quick 3 min video of me talking through the features), you can go to: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dittowords.com&#x2F;developers"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dittowords.com&#x2F;developers</a>.

The _real_ magic of ASP .NET was implicit state management... you didn&#x27;t have to know anything about sessions, cookies, HTTP, CSRF, or LocalStorage (which, sadly, was around for some of Web Forms&#x27;s heyday because many devs clung onto it for much longer than they should have). The whole point of Web Forms was to replicate the WinForms experience in a web context so that devs didn&#x27;t have to reason so much about client vs server state. Everything was rendered server-side and state was retained via a combination of session and the aforementioned &quot;ViewState&quot;, which was basically a massive encrypted form field with the application state that got submitted with every request.<p>It could probably be argued that Web Forms doesn&#x27;t even really qualify as web development.

182,"&gt; Monopolies are inherently harmful to the customer. A monopoly implies lack of competition.<p>I disagree.  When you look at a company that is dominant in some part of the marketplace at a given point it time, you need to understand how they got there.  The monopoly poster child Standard Oil rose-up when there used to be many more oil processing companies, but Standard Oil was able to do things for cheaper because they used more byproducts from the oil to create different products (which let them sell things like lamp oil for less).  So sometimes monopolies rise-up because that one company is able to fill a market segment better than the competition.<p>The question then becomes, once they have a monopoly and others see this, how can potential competitors react.  Can others copy (and improve) the same processing system that the monopoly has to produce a similar product for a similar price (maybe even less)?  If so, then they can rise up and the original company will no longer be a monopoly.  But if that original company takes steps to squelch the competition, you start getting into what the US has defined as &quot;anti competitive&quot; practices.  These were developed because the past showed us that this leads to harming consumers.<p>We also have a lot of government granted monopolies.  Copyright and IP law are time-limited monopolies on a given product.  We have private business that operate on federal land (like national parks) that may be given a local monopoly within that region.  Sometimes we make tradeoffs and grant monopolies.",finance,,
344,"My go-to example would be the module system:<p>1. 90% of the time, rust module layouts are basically a copy of the file-system heirarchy, so why do I have to type this?  This system would be much more approachable if it gave the file-system hierarchy as the default module layout, and let you override it explicitly.  The argument I have heard against this is that some people like to comment out module declarations during debugging.  I don&#x27;t find this compelling, because I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t have an explicit way to ignore a module instead.  This is just one of many cases where Rust seems to prioritize the edge case at the expense of the common case.<p>2. On top of requiring a lot of boilerplate the module system is quite esoteric.  I&#x27;ve had to learn it twice: a few years ago I was dabbling in Rust, and I remember having to struggle a bit to understand how to add a second file to my project, and then about a year ago when I was getting back into rust I found it unintuitive a second time.  I challenge you to find someone who is unfamiliar with the module system, and see how long it takes them, using <i>only</i> the documentation, to figure out where they have to put the `mod` declarations to add nested submodules to their project to make it compile.  Maybe I am unreasonably thick, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my problem since I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of languages, and never had this much trouble.<p>3. This esoteric system isn&#x27;t even deterministic.  Imagine I have the line `mod foo` in my `lib.rs`.  Where can I go to find the source for that?  Well, it depends.  It could be in `src&#x2F;foo.rs`, or it could be in `src&#x2F;foo&#x2F;mod.rs`.  And let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m using external crate: `use some_crate`.  Which import does that correspond to?  It could be: `some_crate`, or it could be `some-crate` in my `Cargo.toml`.  You just have to kind of know all of these implicit behaviors of the compiler to know what&#x27;s going on.<p>So this is just one feature, but IMO it&#x27;s just one example of a case where Rust puts very little emphasis on the UX and understandability of the language.",web/mobile,,

I need to exchange ownership of a hardware wallet (like a physical USB device) for a pre-determined amount of state fiat, lets say USD in this case. In order to facilitate this I need to find a trusted seller, arrange a meeting, verify the actual value of the physical wallet, and make the exchange. There are non-physical means of making it <i>harder</i> to trace state fiat back to you, but not impossible. The state has simply had too much influence over these places of transaction for too long for anybody to be truly un-findable given a long enough period of time.<p>Assuming I can find someone willing to on-ramp me like this I will need to take steps to ensure that our communications are encrypted and untraceable. This means not only do I need a decentralized encrypted messaging service, I also need to conduct this communication in a way that does not give away my geographical location and is not vulnerable to security logs (say by checking the cafe&#x27;s video feed from the time I was messaging my seller). Then I need to go to the meet, exchange the physical wallet for cash, and verify the amount in it is accurate (and also preferably not stolen). I need to do this without revealing my identity to my seller and avoiding security logs once again. This is all now possible whereas before Satoshi it was impossible, but it is still difficult.<p>Alternatively, I could just sell some kind of digital asset in exchange for ZCash to begin with.

I do hope that some of it will get better once certain features land and it is certainly an area where some additional complexity is unavoidable, but it is the only part of Rust that I dread touching despite heavily using async in a moderately sized personal project due to the need for WASM + IndexedDB, simply because lifetime issues become much more tricky once async and either traits, recursion or closures are involved. By now I am consciously trying to limit any async parts of the program to a simple and stupid &quot;Rust-light&quot; style without any &quot;fancy&quot; features such as traits or closures, which does not feel like a proper solution.

So many people don&#x27;t get it.<p>Movies used to be made where the actors were all familiar with stage performance techniques and didn&#x27;t know how to perform for a camera.  So many people don&#x27;t get it.<p>Movies used to have really wooden camera shots because the camera weighted 500 pounds.  So many people don&#x27;t get it.<p>&gt; Who cares? Just enjoy the movie. If you can&#x27;t - read a physics book.<p>Somebody has a preference that you don&#x27;t share, but instead of just ignoring them you had to tell them that they&#x27;re wrong.  Without any proof.  And while enjoying movie improvements that have been going on for over a century.<p>That person just wants movies to be better.  If you think that movies shouldn&#x27;t be better why don&#x27;t you go back to watching black and white moving pictures?",general,,
331,"Thanks for the explanation. I&#x27;m not a gender pronouns pedant in any way, my question was asked purely from an educational perspective.<p>My native language is Russian, which is generally a gendered (masculine&#x2F;feminine&#x2F;neuter) language. Nouns have gender. It mostly follows the spelling of the words - i.e. if a word ends with a certain vowel. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work that way, mostly with loanwords. In other cases the historical form of the word did match a pattern, and was assigned a gender accordingly - and then changed (e.g. by re-loaning it in a more accurate spelling), and no longer fits. When that happens, people will use the more &quot;appropriate&quot; rather than the &quot;right&quot; gender in colloquial speech, and eventually it becomes the new standard, collecting the mismatch.<p>A good example of this is the Russian word &quot;coffee&quot;. When it was first loaned back in 18th century, it was &quot;kofiy&quot; - and in Russian, that is definitely masculine. Eventually it got re-loaned as &quot;kofe&quot;, which would normally be neuter; but the masculine gender assignment stayed from past spelling. In the dictionaries, that is - in practice treating the word as neuter became one of the common incorrect colloquialisms, just because it doesn&#x27;t &quot;look&quot; masculine. Language purists fought this for several decades, and eventually lost: it&#x27;s still nominally masculine, but neuter is considered an &quot;accepted variant&quot; in modern dictionaries.<p>So to a Russian speaker, say, New York and Texas are masculine, while California and Florida are feminine. So, when I read &quot;she&quot; in @antirez&#x27;s article, I was immediately confused, like, did I miss a character introduced in the previous paragraph or ...who is _she_?<p>In my writings, instead of saying &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, I try to call people by the exact meaning of what I&#x27;m writing about, eg engineer, manager, programmer, etc. No idea why it&#x27;s not THE way to end all the pronouns dilemmas in English.",general,,
251,"Thanks for the reply. You are right that I conflated wealth with money. For a broad definition of wealth I think I can agree with you then.<p>As for n95, perhaps it was different in US, but in Poland there was no way I could find one in March. You couldn’t find them online anywhere regardless of price, and when I asked around, nobody had them available. I honestly wonder where could I make such an offer online - craigslist?<p>As for Titanic, agree.",general,,
252,"&gt; Google gets away with this a lot<p>I think the point seen here is really that if the standards org doesn&#x27;t impact the browsers and the browser in question has greater than 60% market share then that browser is the standards org and the W3C doesn&#x27;t matter. Who is going to harm Google? How would the W3C enforce their standards? If most of your users are on Chrome and Chrome sets the feature set rather than the W3C, why wouldn&#x27;t you just build to Chrome?",web/mobile,,
253,"I think &quot;y&#x27;all&quot; is becoming more common at least in part out of an interest to avoid &quot;you guys,&quot; which people perceive to be overly gendered. I notice (in my own speech and others&#x27;) &quot;folks&quot; replacing &quot;guys&quot; in other contexts, for the same reason. The fact that both make everyone sound a little more casual, and a little more southern, is probably mostly a side effect -- general American English just doesn&#x27;t have obvious gender-neutral words to fill those semantic functions.",general,,
332,"For most people, it’s not as simple as deciding to make friends with locals.  People have various heuristics to determine the probability of rate of return (not financially speaking, but all around) on certain relationships, including differences in socioeconomic status, cultural background, age, etc.<p>The locals also probably already have their own friend circles (or tribes or whatever you want to call it), and it might take a lot of effort to break in, especially if there is a group of expats that are easier to communicate with.",general,,

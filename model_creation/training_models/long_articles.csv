1990,2021-05-22,"Hi! This is a fun question. Certainly, thermal equilibrium involves something called the equipartition theorem, which says that all of the energy is divided equally across all of the degrees of freedom so that each has an average small amount of energy which we call the temperature. (It&#x27;s hard to define temperature in any other circumstance! But let&#x27;s not get into ensembles.)<p>The big caution with the gradient idea is that you can get uncomfortably close, if you are not paying attention, to saying that refrigerators are impossible. An energy flow from degree of freedom A to degree of freedom B manages to “slurp up” some of this thermal energy from a system&#x27;s degrees of freedom and move them to another system, one gradient undoes a flow across a different gradient. And like, this happens all the time in everyone&#x27;s kitchen.<p>Information erasure looks like this: a bit needs to look like a degree of freedom with some energy stored above the baseline average. It could be energy neutral in that you might have two degrees of freedom, {ifZero, ifOne}, so that a NOT gate doesn&#x27;t take any energy, but just swaps the energy in the two degrees of freedom. But the energy stored in one or the other needs to be roughly one temperature*, or so. And the reason why is that “equipartition” specifies an average, but there is also a standard deviation: these are the energy fluctuations in thermal equilibrium. So, as a result of Ludwig Boltzmann we know that this is an exponentially-distributed random variable and therefore the standard deviation is equal to the mean. So if you want your bits to not be thermally excited, they need to hold a few temperatures’ worth of energy.<p>Information erasure says that the only circuits on these bits which preserve the energy levels inside them, are reversible circuits like NOT. Irreversible dynamics can look like reversible dynamics plus erasure: in the simplest erasure, we drain both ifZero and ifOne energies into the environment and then we refill ifZero from some energy reservoir. And this says basically that there is nothing much better than that for erasing a bit.<p>So, just like the ratchet had a spring that was kept at low energy in order to facilitate a transfer of energy from cold to hot, and could only work as long as you kept that spring well-refrigerated, Maxwell&#x27;s demon has a similar “coldness buffer” in terms of these bits that are present in a definite prepared state ahead of time. The information processing step takes it out of that zero state, and if it wants to go back there it has to erase, but that requires dumping some energy out into an environment, and getting energy from some reservoir to compensate. And then Maxwell&#x27;s demon becomes just a normal refrigerator like the other ones that we know about.",finance,general,AI/Data Science

This costs teams time and effort, but too many times, data debt is difficult to measure. There are two primary drivers that drive the cost of data debt and lead to understanding your need for a data discovery tool:<p>Discovery time: Data discovery time is the amount of time that it takes for your data engineering and analytics team to find the right data, understand what it means and use it to analyze the data request.<p>Organization time: This is the amount of time spent cleaning, documenting and organizing data to make it legible for other employees<p>You can measure the financial impact of data debt by looking at how much money it costs your team to discover and organize the data. We recommend calculating data debt as the hours spent discovering + organizing data * average cost per hour.<p>By having an idea of the cost of data debt, teams can more easily calculate their return on investment for a data discovery tool. Without the existing baseline, it’s much more difficult to get buy-in from the managers controlling the budget for your team. We hope this helps.",AI/Data Science,general,AI/Data Science

930,2021-05-22,"I&#x27;d like to highlight the Introduction of nmcp.pdf which explains in a very compressed form how it works which encompass all the magic.<p>&quot;The lossless data compressor employs the traditional predictive approach:  at each time t, the encoder uses the neural network model to compute the probability vector p of the next symbol values t knowing all the preceding symbols s0 up to st−1. The  actual  symbol  value st is  encoded  using  an  arithmetic encoder  with approximately −log2 ( pst ) bits. Then the model is updated knowing the symbol st. The decoder works symmetrically so there is no need to transmit the model parameters. It implies both encoder and decoder update their model identically.<p>When  no  preprocessing  is  done, st represents  the  byte  at  position t. Hence there are Ns= 256 different symbol values from 0 to Ns−1.&quot;<p>For those usually familiar with Huffman coding this is using an Arithmetic coding <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arithmetic_coding"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arithmetic_coding</a><p>It allows adaptive coding (i.e. changing the probabilities of symbols dynamically). Here these probabilities are modelled dynamically using a neural network.<p>The magic is that the neural network parameters are defined implicitly : You don&#x27;t need to transmit the neural network parameters, therefore you can use as big as you want neural network.<p>During the decoding the from scratch network is continuously trained using the freshly decoded data, in the same way that it was during the encoding. The more data you compress, the more you train the internal neural network parameters, and the better the prediction for next character gets.<p>You decode 20 bytes, you update the model with this new data, you decode 20 new bytes with the new model, you update the model,... , every 1000000 bytes you can even update your model multiple times using all currently available data to make the network converge faster.<p>Of course this only works if everything is exactly deterministic, which Fabrice Bellard took great effort in guaranteeing, which is no small engineering feat.",web/mobile,general,AI/Data Science

That&#x27;s what I was aiming to get at in the call for evidence. Is x86 inherently inferior to arm and cannot scale as well for large super scalar CPUs because the decoder drags you down or is Apple just better at micro-architecture design (perhaps AMD&#x27;s team would also fail to scale well beyond 4 wide with an arm design, perhaps Apple&#x27;s team could have built an x86 M1).",AI/Data Science,finance,AI/Data Science

You put a message in and consumers just roll over them. Rabbit&#x2F;amqp is random access, Kafka sucks at random access. With amqp, you’ll have hundreds&#x2F;thousands of queues, this may be difficult with Kafka.<p>You’d use Kafka more as an unbounded buffer and build different paradigms on top of it. It not unusual to ingest 100s if mbits of data into kafka, potentially saturating the network while also reading that much out.

That said security fixes will of course continue to be shipped (I don’t say this with any internal knowledge of Xorg maintainable, only trust in the FOSS ecosystem). Of course, the user base is still huge.<p>&gt; Rewriting your code in Wayland is always going to introduce new bugs, including security bugs, that wouldn’t be there if you just maintained the Xorg code. Maybe there are undiscovered bugs lurking in your Xorg codebase, but as your codebase ages under continuous maintenance, that number will only shrink.<p>Xorg is insecure.

It makes all this more convenient, and possibly scale better.<p>But what people really argue for is that it makes the system much less prone to corruption and manipulation, because the system of tracking is much more resilient to being tempered with.<p>For example, right now Joe Shmoe could fabricate a fake paper deed showing that his great grandma owned the Mona Lisa, and it is thus his. And then sue the French government saying they need to either buy it off him or return it to him. Now you&#x27;d need forensic experts and all to try and check the authenticity of that deed and all that.<p>Now this is a bit of a stupid example obviously. What if the deed was real? Would the government still say well oh crap here you go? I guess that will depend on the French government and their laws.<p>But say the laws of France were such that yes, it should indeed therefore be returned to Joe.<p>Well with blockchain, the idea is that this wouldn&#x27;t happen. First the &quot;deed&quot; would have never been lost, the ledger tells you who owns what, there&#x27;d be no confusion. Second, Joe (if he was lying), wouldn&#x27;t be able to create a &quot;fake&quot; entry in the ledger as easily as maybe he can fabricate a deed. Now that&#x27;s up for debate, but in theory a decentralized ledger need you to temper with all the nodes, so it&#x27;s possibly much more difficult to scam with.<p>And back to the example in the article, the Mona Lisa would be transfered from the government to Joe, there&#x27;d be a record of this. Now the question is no longer, is this record valid? We know this happened, the question becomes was this transaction initiated fradulently? Obviously the computer doesn&#x27;t know why the transaction came to be, just that it for sure did, not tempered with, no fake claims, this did happen and we know exactly from where and to where, and exactly what was it that was transacted.<p>Now you need people to investigate and asses if the transaction was fraudulent.

Gold, a popular store of value is much more volatile than the US dollars but if you held gold from 50 years ago, you&#x27;d be up 37X against the dollar [0]. What makes something a good store of value is how scarce and easy to transfer both across space and time it is. Bitcoin can&#x27;t be blamed for the casino mentality, it&#x27;s up to market actors to use bitcoin as a store of value and from what I&#x27;ve observed, that&#x27;s going to be the long term outcome.<p>Bitcoin is slow: The argument that bitcoin is slow and expensive is a fallacy. Bitcoin is a settlement layer and when evaluating  the speed of a settlement layer, the emphasis should be on speed of settlement assurances and transaction finality[1]. Bitcoin being an open decentralized settlement layer makes this even more important. Comparing bitcoin to visa or sepa which don&#x27;t settle instantly is disingenuous at best and ignorant at worst. If you want faster transactions, use a layer 2 solution like the lightening network which is orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than visa [2].<p>Bitcoin is ponzi scheme: This is a complete fallacy both in theory and in practice and it&#x27;s pretty offensive to suggest that well-meaning people working hard to make finance open and globally accessible are a cabal of scammers looking to steal money from unsuspecting investors. Surely there are bad actors but that&#x27;s the case in any industry.<p>Don&#x27;t believe me? Bitcoin chainanalysis shows emphatically that the vast majority of coins that moved in this crash were new spends in the past months which shows that it&#x27;s the new buyers that are selling[3], where then is the pyramid scheme? In fact, The early adopters of bitcoin are the least likely to sell. I hold bitcoin not to sell and many in my network are like me(although I can&#x27;t speak for them).

 Pretty much the only trade you wouldn&#x27;t want to be in is commodities like lumber, wheat, or steel, where there is constantly new supply coming online.<p>I&#x27;m still skeptical that this will actually be the case: once &quot;sticky&quot; prices like wages or consumer durables start going up, it puts more money in consumer pockets, which means they can spend more, which means businesses can raise prices, which gives employees leverage to demand more CoL increases.  Cue wage&#x2F;price spiral.  And we&#x27;re already seeing these increases in wages, consumer durables, and advertising, with no signs of a Fed tightening yet.<p>The anatomy of the 1970s inflation wasn&#x27;t a uniform increase in all prices across the board: it was a set of transient price increases in specific industries, which then abated but were followed by price increases in other industries, which again abated but were followed by increases in wages (in <i>some</i> professions - income inequality increased dramatically in the 70s) and financing costs.  We didn&#x27;t realize inflation was a problem until it started showing up in mortgage rates around 1977 - inflation dropped rapidly from 1974-1976 (from 12.2% - 4.8%), and it appeared that it was a transitory problem resulting from the 1973 oil shocks.",finance,finance,finance

1108,2021-05-22,"I&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time on &#x27;bad science&#x27; as a topic lately (check my comment history or blog for some examples). I think what you&#x27;re proposing is the opposite of what&#x27;s required.<p>Firstly, the problem here is not an epidemic of scientists who feel too financially insecure to do good work. Many of the worst papers are being written by people with decades-long careers and who lead large labs. Their funding is very secure. They are doing bad work anyway for other reasons, sometimes political or ideological, more often because doing bad work results in attention, praise and power. Or sometimes because they don&#x27;t know how to explain their chosen question, but don&#x27;t want to admit that scientifically they failed and don&#x27;t know where to go next.<p>Secondly, as you already realized your proposal relies on identifying which scientists have a proven track record, but the whole problem is that science is flooded with fraudulent&#x2F;garbage claims which are highly cited (&quot;proven&quot;) and which were written by large teams of supposedly respectable scientists at supposedly respectable institutions. Any metric you can invent to decide who or what has a proven track record is going to be circular in this regard. To Rumsfeld the problem, we are surrounded by &quot;unknown knowns&quot;. You say this is an open question but to me that&#x27;s a fatal flaw.<p>So the problem is actually the inverse. You say at the end, well, scientists who can fund their own work are an exception. Obviously in most cases scientists don&#x27;t need to do this, they can also be funded by companies. Most computer science research works this way. Better CPUs and hardware is done almost entirely by companies. AI research has been driven by corporate scientists, and so on. In contrast academic funding comes primarily from government agencies that distribute money according to the desires of academics themselves. This means a tiny number of people control large sums of money, and they are accountable to nobody except themselves. There are no systems or controls on academic behavior except peer review, which is largely useless because the peers are doing the same bad things as everyone else.<p>Viewed from an economic perspective academia is a planned reputation economy. The state is the source of all resource allocation decisions (academics being effectively state employees in most fields). There&#x27;s also a deeply embedded Marxist worldview: universities have no working mechanisms to detect fraud, because of an implicit assumption that deep down when market forces are gone everyone is automatically honest and good. The hierarchy is stagnant; the same institutions remain at the top for centuries. A good reputation lets them select the people with the reputation for being smart (e.g. by school grade), so that reputation accrues to the institutions, which lets them keep selecting intake by reputation and so on. E.g. supposedly Oxford and Cambridge are the best UK universities, they always have been, and they always will be. In a competitive, free market economy they would face competition and other institutions would seek to figure out what their secret is and copy it, like how so many companies try to copy the Toyota Way. In science this doesn&#x27;t happen because there&#x27;s nothing to copy: these institutions aren&#x27;t actually different.<p>This implies a simple solution: privatize it all. It would be wrenching, just like it was when the USSR transitioned to a market economy, just like it was when China (sort of) did the same. But one thing the 20th century teaches us is that you can&#x27;t really fix the problems of a planned economy by tinkering with small reforms at the edges. The Soviets weren&#x27;t able to fix their culture with glasnost and perestroika. They eventually had to give up on the whole thing. Replacing the current reputation economy with a real economy, with all the mechanisms that economic system has evolved (markets, prices, regulators, court cases, fraud laws etc), seems like a more direct and obvious approach to making things better, even if it may sound extreme.",general,general,general

A few &quot;Plant fat sources&quot; consist mostly of saturated fat, e.g. cocoa butter<p>2. Some &quot;Plant fat sources&quot; have a fatty acid content consisting mostly of oleic acid (mono-unsaturated), e.g. olive oil, cashew nuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pistachio<p>3. Some &quot;Plant fat sources&quot; have a fatty acid content consisting mostly of linoleic acid (poly-unsaturated), e.g. sunflower oil and most other cheap vegetable oils, many seeds<p>4. A few &quot;Plant fat sources&quot; have a fatty acid content consisting also mostly of poly-unsaturated fatty acids, but with a large proportion of alpha-linolenic acid, e.g. walnuts, flaxseed and a few others.<p>The rules for a healthy diet are simple:<p>1. Most of the fatty food eaten should belong to the second class from above, i.e. plant fat sources with mostly oleic acid<p>The reason is that this corresponds to the normal composition of the human body fat, so it can be used with maximum efficiency as an energy source or for cellular membranes, without requiring expensive transformations in the liver.<p>2. Any fat sources from the other classes may be eaten, but in smaller quantities.<p>3. The vegetable fat sources must be supplemented every day with a small quantity of fat containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (DHA &amp; EPA). The cheapest and most convenient way is to use cod liver oil or another kind of fish oil.<p>Rich vegans can pay 7 or 8 times more for a similar oil extracted from certain algae (algae is the commercially used word; it is not the most appropriate but there exist no more appropriate non-scientific names for those uni-cellular organisms).",general,finance,general

Firstly, given that these folks have (presumably so,  but many folks plead guilty to crimes they have not committed, which is a travesty, but beyond the scope of this comment) committed a crime is pretty clear proof that they are having issues integrating into society.<p>Secondly, except for those who commit violent crimes (a minority of inmates), most folks will be released at some point.<p>Once those folks are released, they are now responsible for taking care of themselves economically and living in society.  If we continue doing what we do now, by not giving them tools and skills to reintegrate into society and stigmatizing them for life, we severely limit their ability to live as productive members of society.<p>This has a negative effect on society (in that these folks are being actively discriminated against and shut out from many decent jobs) and limits the productivity and economic output of these people in performing jobs compatible with society.<p>Those are huge negatives for <i>all of us</i>.

I actually have little interest in making great claims about consciousness, I just have to use it because the idea of <i>the flow of time</i> is made to be a conscious illusion instead of ontologically real by this very interpretation of the maths of physics. This is hardly my idea though, and I have been paraphrasing people like Harvey Brown, Tegmark, and Barbour the whole time. And the idea of a static block universe dates back to early 1900&#x27;s, and eternalism back to antiquity. If I have failed and come off pretentious, that&#x27;s my fault and not theirs.<p><i>Of course there is state change</i>. Of course the sun will rise tomorrow. Of course a state machine will evolve deterministically based on some inputs.<p>Those are all described mathematically. But the mathematical laws of physics alone must then be interpreted in some way to describe reality. I mean look at the debate over which interpretation to apply to the same maths of QM for an example. Physics is not mathematics, it applies explanations.<p>And what these physicists above argue is that the math of the laws of physics does not necessitate an ontological, mind-independent flow of time to the universe. That we do experience a flow of time is not under question. We do. What is under question is that since the laws of physics (i.e. the math) works without an ontological flow of time (note: flow of time is a different idea than &quot;time&quot; or &quot;arrow of time&quot;, neither of which I am arguing about here. We are only talking about the flow of time), why do we have it. Well, they say, through the sequentialism of memories and physical, sensorial data. Nothing woo.<p>So no one is denying the flow of time as experience. Just like you can&#x27;t deny &quot;redness&quot; or &quot;hotness&quot;. They are experienced by us, but some also think we can explain them in naturalistic, scientific ways. And that will require a neuroscience perspective on some level.

I was the 3rd employee, but my stock was negligible - incidentally the company wasn’t very transparent about this; When the offer was made they said, we’ll give you 5000 shares which sounded like a decent amount.

This is in London where this is probably quite common.<p>The sad thing was it was one of the most interesting places and domains I’ve worked, and if the company launched while I was there, it probably would have been acquired (like all our competitors). The founder was quite innovative but think was scared to launch and had a new idea&#x2F;approach to market every few months. Eventually I lost faith, and being expected to work late every evening knowing my options were tiny killed all motivation.<p>As the author said, I calculated my expected earnings, decided it’s no longer worth it and left. The moment that changed my outlook was when they decided not to approve my leave (I had already booked and didn’t expect any issues since I had mentioned it in conversation a few months before). If I had stayed, I would haven’t enjoyed all the travelling and experiences I’ve had, earning more and working less.<p>The company is still going, and probably a long way off from having any exit.

6075,2021-05-25,"&gt; That&#x27;s the story that GC sold us. History has proven it wrong. Citation: the fire hose of articles on HN about how GC bit people in the ass, and they now have to go back into their code and write a bunch of duct tape code to work around Garbage Collector Quirk #4018 de jure that results in hitching, insane memory usage, and random OOMs.<p>I follow HN daily and very rarely do I see articles lamenting GC (I&#x27;m only familiar with a small handful of incidents including some pathological cases with Go&#x27;s GC on enormous heaps (many terrabytes) and some complaints about Java&#x27;s GC having too many knobs), certainly not in the general case. Indeed, for the most part people seem quite happy with GC languages, especially Go&#x27;s sub-ms GC. In particular, memory usage (and thus OOMs) have nothing to do with GC--it&#x27;s every bit as easy to use a lot of memory in a language that lacks GC altogether. This is incorrect, full stop.<p>&gt; I say GC is a failed experiment because it promised that programmers would be able to write code without worrying about memory.<p>GC promises that programmers don&#x27;t have to worry about freeing memory correctly, and it delivers on that promise. I&#x27;m not a GC purist--there&#x27;s lots of criticism to be had for GC, but we don&#x27;t need point at patently false criticisms.<p>&gt; The borrow checker is an infantile incarnation of a bigger idea that is finally panning out. Rather than garbage collecting during run-time; garbage collect during compilation using static analysis. Being in its infancy it&#x27;s not as easy and free to use as we&#x27;d like. But it&#x27;s the path forward.<p>Maybe. I like the idea, but I&#x27;m skeptical that putting constraints on the programmer is going to be an economical solution, at least for so long as the economics favor rapid development over performance. Conceivably rather than rejecting code that aggrieves the borrow checker, we could picture a language that converts those references into garbage collected pointers transparently, but we kind of have this already today via escape analysis--and indeed, I think this is the economic sweet spot for memory management because it lets users have a GC by default but also minimize their allocations for hot paths.<p>&gt; Hence my comment: &quot;A little bit of time spent now appeasing the borrow checker will pay off ten fold later when you don&#x27;t have to deal with exploding memory usage and GC stalls in production.&quot;<p>But the borrow checker is strictly less effective in preventing memory leaks than a (tracing) GC (borrow checker will happily allow circular refcounts). More importantly, having to pacify the borrow checker on <i>every single codepath</i> when only 1-2% of code paths are ever going to be problematic is not a good use of your time, especially when you can do some light refactoring to optimize. With respect to GC stalls, these are particularly rare if you have a GC that is tuned to low-latency (Go&#x27;s GC can free all memory in less than a millisecond in most cases).<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not about performance; it&#x27;s about saving yourself the time of having to come back to your code a month later because your TODO app is using a gig of RAM and randomly hitching.<p>That sounds like the textbook definition of a performance concern, but again memory usage is orthogonal to GC and random hitching isn&#x27;t a problem for latency-tuned GCs. Even while Rust is faster than many of its GC counterparts, this difference typically comes down to the ability of the compiler to output optimized code--not the memory management system. That said, for realtime applications, nondeterministic GCs aren&#x27;t appropriate.",web/mobile,general,web/mobile

15,2021-05-17,"&gt; What if you don&#x27;t have an event loop though?<p>You can use my second-favorite technique: dedicate a thread to signals. Block the signals of interest, causing them to be queued. Do this early in main(), before spawning any threads, so that they&#x27;ll inherit the block. Spawn a thread which dequeues in a loop via sigwaitinfo or sigtimedwait. Signal handling without a signal handler!<p>&gt; Roughly? What are the differences [between the self-pipe trick and signalfd]? The most obvious to me is the fact I can read siginfo structures from the file descriptor.<p>That&#x27;s the difference I mean. If you want to get those from the self-pipe trick, you need to do it yourself, dealing with the platform difference crap this article describes. Additionally, if you write more than one byte per signal, you&#x27;ll have to be careful of half-written messages, since your signal handler can&#x27;t block for capacity. (Why? It may be blocking the thread that does the reading, so it&#x27;d deadlock.) Maybe you&#x27;d have a separate buffer for the leftover part that doesn&#x27;t quite fit, or ensure your your message size divides evenly into the pipe buffer capacity (see F_GETPIPE_SZ), or drop messages if there&#x27;s insufficient capacity (use FIONREAD; the capacity shouldn&#x27;t go down unless you&#x27;re using the same pipe for multiple signals and don&#x27;t have them masking each other out). Stuff like this can get complex but the basic technique of just ensuring ctrl-C reaches your event loop isn&#x27;t that bad. You have to be very careful in the signal handler, but it&#x27;s like five lines long, so life goes on.<p>Another difference is that installing a self-pipe handler lets you see the previous handler (if any). I&#x27;ve heard of chaining handlers to address complaints like kstenerud&#x27;s about libraries. I&#x27;ve never actually wanted to share signals like that, but it&#x27;s something one could try.

Search is worthless. It&#x27;s basically only useful for exact string matches on app names. And even then, you get the competitor app&#x27;s ad that takes up 80% of the screen. They took every bad aspect of Google&#x27;s search (the confusing take-up too much space ads), with none of the good parts (you know, the actual searching smarts).<p>2. The review section sucks. Instead of providing a streamlined system to get help from the developer, they just give you a place to rant. Reading the reviews isn&#x27;t exactly ergonomic on a phone screen either, so it&#x27;s just a waste bin to throw complaints at. Imagine if Apple actually lived up to their lip service of app quality and integrated a support mechanism that would reward apps that promptly replied (they would be marked with the &quot;helpful developer&quot; badge and get more prominent search placement for example).<p>3. Discovery is non-existent. At some point in the last 5 years I kind of just stopped &quot;window shopping&quot; the AppStore. I used to think that the Top Charts were a lazy way to encourage trying new things out -- but wow, it was way better than what we have now. The first thing the AppStore shoves in my face is these absurdly long profiles on developers or whatever as if the AppStore is a magazine I want to read. I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t care about some editorial article about the makers of some game. And it takes up the entirety of the start screen instead of trying to customize a variety of app suggestions <i>just for me</i>.  This is such a missed opportunity. I would spend so much more money on the AppStore if it helped me at all to see new things. The experience instead requires you to be proactive to find things. Hence why it&#x27;s really just a glorified database that&#x27;s only really useful if you already know exactly what you want ahead of time.<p>4. It isn&#x27;t safe at all. There are so many scams on the store. Subscription scams, etc. Apple does this weird thing where they simultaneously pretend they don&#x27;t exist, <i>and uses them as proof that their arcane review system is needed</i>.

If it does have scams, they say &quot;see, this is why the filters are so necessary, imagine how much worse it would be without them!&quot;.

The vegetable fat sources must be supplemented every day with a small quantity of fat containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (DHA &amp; EPA).

It’s not like merchants across the economy  were going to accept Bitcoin, but decided to hold onto it instead. Nor was the economy using Bitcoin to trade goods when people started hoarding Bitcoin instead. There are lots of reasons Bitcoin, or gold, or whatever isn’t used as a currency in place of the USD.

Investment cannot occur without deferring consumption. All investment comes from saving wealth from consumption. When currency is inflationary it simply drives real savings towards other assets, like stocks, real estate, etc., and this effect strengthens the more inflationary the currency. It creates a world like the one we have now, where investment in stocks is not about capitalizing entrepreneurial ventures, but parking savings to avoid debasement. Buying up property and stocks to preserve capital is not investment in the sense that capital is being used to increase production of things consumers want or need, but to avoid loss.",finance,finance,

776,2021-05-19,"I appreciate your criticism! I never read much of Penrose, and find a lot of what he says outside of mathematics to be questionable. I also think I have an incredibly loose idea of consciousness and remain fairly uncommitted. I actually have little interest in making great claims about consciousness, I just have to use it because the idea of <i>the flow of time</i> is made to be a conscious illusion instead of ontologically real by this very interpretation of the maths of physics. This is hardly my idea though, and I have been paraphrasing people like Harvey Brown, Tegmark, and Barbour the whole time. And the idea of a static block universe dates back to early 1900&#x27;s, and eternalism back to antiquity. If I have failed and come off pretentious, that&#x27;s my fault and not theirs.<p><i>Of course there is state change</i>. Of course the sun will rise tomorrow. Of course a state machine will evolve deterministically based on some inputs.<p>Those are all described mathematically. But the mathematical laws of physics alone must then be interpreted in some way to describe reality. I mean look at the debate over which interpretation to apply to the same maths of QM for an example. Physics is not mathematics, it applies explanations.<p>And what these physicists above argue is that the math of the laws of physics does not necessitate an ontological, mind-independent flow of time to the universe. That we do experience a flow of time is not under question. We do. What is under question is that since the laws of physics (i.e. the math) works without an ontological flow of time (note: flow of time is a different idea than &quot;time&quot; or &quot;arrow of time&quot;, neither of which I am arguing about here. We are only talking about the flow of time), why do we have it. Well, they say, through the sequentialism of memories and physical, sensorial data. Nothing woo.<p>So no one is denying the flow of time as experience. Just like you can&#x27;t deny &quot;redness&quot; or &quot;hotness&quot;. They are experienced by us, but some also think we can explain them in naturalistic, scientific ways. And that will require a neuroscience perspective on some level. I only bring in consciousness to the extent needed, as it is intimately connected to our perceived &quot;flow of time&quot;.<p>We have to keep clear, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;flow of time&quot;, and &quot;arrow of time&quot;. In earlier posts I did say Barbour thinks &quot;time&quot; is a redundant term; needless baggage on top of just caring about particles and relations to other particles. That in turn morphed into how we can recreate the experience we all have of time-flowing if there really are only particles and forces - no magic of the mind. To explain that, I had to talk about how the flow of time might not be ontologically real. And neuroscientists and physicists will then have to show how our experience is reducible to particles and forces (or fields).",general,general,
777,2021-05-19,"American law allows for a very wide range of legal trusts. Courts will generally enforce any legal entity that the grantor chooses to structure. It&#x27;s easy enough to setup the DAO as a formal legal trust that grants ownership rights to whoever can demonstrate ownership of an NFT.<p>Some people might ask what the point is. After all, you&#x27;re still relying on a fair and enforceable court system at a base layer. That&#x27;s true, but it allows you to abstract away all the other complexities from higher layers in the financial system. For example the cost of transferring title on land tends to be fairly high. You have stamp tax, title insurance, lawyers to review the contract, etc. With a DAO as the nominal owner, selling property simply becomes a matter of executing a smart contract transaction on the blockchain.<p>From there, you can imagine increasingly complex structures built entirely in the blockchain. A mortgage based smart contract can allow for a specific owner, but transfer the property to the creditor once the payment is missed. Mortgage underwriters can pool their blockchain based loans into pooled securities, and sell CDO-like products as smart contracts. This allows investors to completely bypass all the financial regulations and restrictions that exist on subprime mortgages.<p>It also cuts out an enormous amount of the legal, settlement, and due diligence costs associated with the creation of these securities. Everything&#x27;s executed atomically and autonomously through smart contracts.

857,2021-05-19,"&gt; Git lets you rewrite history<p>Not quite true. Git makes it possible to hard fork it’s internal commit tree, and easily move the HEAD marker to your new fork. But it’s obvious to everyone observing the tree that the modification has happened.<p>Same applies to all normal blockchains. Only difference is that blockchain clients will ignore that fork if the correct proof work hasn’t been provided, but you could add that to a git commit if you really wanted too.<p>The git commit tree is cryptographically signed, every commit is identified by its cryptographic hash, and that has is taken from the content of the commit, which includes the hash of the parent commits. So you can cryptographically prove that a specific git tree is properly linked together, and the each individual commit hasn’t been tampered with.<p>The ability to detect tampered commits, and observe forks is all you really need for a blockchain. Everything else is just deciding how you determine which branch is the “real” branch. But you don’t need proof of work for that, it could be enforced by courts or governments the old fashioned way.<p>As for your PR stuff. You can fix that by publishing an agreed set of valid commit types, which limits the types of modifications that are allowable. Then when validating a tree, you ignore commits that don’t meet that specification (just like more traditional blockchains do).<p>Ultimately the only novel thing blockchains bring to the table is proof of work algorithms etc which allow for supposedly decentralised trust.<p>But decentralised trust doesn’t really exist when dealing with physical assets. At the end of the day ownership is determined by your ability to physically defend your assets, or ability to convince the state to defend them on your behalf. So if the state says you don’t own your house (and the courts agree), then the content of your decentralised blockchain is irrelevant because it won’t stop the police from forcibly evicting you.",web/mobile,general,

Personally, there&#x27;s been many times in my career that I would pick up a backlogged bug item and have to dig around months prior for the data to fix it and wished that I could get permission from my boss to write a proper cache server to poll our API data but there was never a perceived time or place to do it. Often the bug couldn&#x27;t be solved because the given API no longer had the data. Also it would be slow for certain APIs and tricky to make sure you don&#x27;t go over your quota.<p>Mostly I think that developers such as myself would like an easy and affordable way to safely just save all their API data without having to write their own servers to transfer and cache and archive it and have it normalized with something like JSON-LD with a more sane API design, and perhaps use SQL or something like it to interface with their cached data. However, for non-technical users, I think a spreadsheet interface would be preferred and would open up your every day user to new world of possibilities. Either or, I feel what matters is taking ownership over your data (which can get expensive to retain with a given API) especially in these ransomware times.

Comparing Linear and Nonlinear Effects of Cognitive Ability on Life Outcomes<p>&gt; Despite a long-standing expert consensus about the importance of cognitive ability for life outcomes, contrary views continue to proliferate in scholarly and popular literature. This divergence of beliefs presents an obstacle for evidence- based policymaking and decision-making in a variety of settings. One commonly held idea is that greater cognitive ability does not matter or is actually harmful beyond a certain point (sometimes stated as &gt; 100 or 120 IQ points). We empirically tested these notions using data from four longitudinal, representative cohort studies comprising 48,558 participants in the United States and United Kingdom from 1957 to the present. We found that ability measured in youth has a positive association with most occupational, educational, health, and social outcomes later in life. Most effects were characterized by a moderate to strong linear trend or a practically null effect (mean R2 range = .002–.256). Nearly all nonlinear effects were practically insignificant in magnitude (mean incremental R2 = .001) or were not replicated across cohorts or survey waves. We found no support for any downside to higher ability and no evidence for a threshold beyond which greater scores cease to be beneficial. Thus, greater cognitive ability is generally advantageous—and virtually never detrimental.

From ads to aisle positioning, junk foods are first. Big Food is the modern day Big Tobacco.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with poor people in different countries, and even with the homeless. A lot of them eat mostly junk food, smoke, drink sodas, chew gum, watch junk TV, some gamble, many don&#x27;t brush often, most don&#x27;t exercise, and many get trapped in unpaid loans.

1161,2021-05-22,"Follows are my reflections on the comments on this thread and on the article re speculation about why there have been no candidate natural viruses revealed, or a definitive origin.<p>People speculate China is concealing malicious intent and such is indicated these two facts (and many others).<p>I&#x27;d like to address these. I think that some people are misjudging why it might be in China&#x27;s interests to <i>not</i> reveal an origin, nor a candidate natural virus, even if it had concluded its internal investigation and discovered definitive answers, even if those answers exculpated China of any mal intent. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re doing this, just offering another perspective with context and strategic reasoning.<p>As China has engaged with the world in the last 15 years, it has founds its soft power advances rebuffed, obstructed and aggressively countered, even as its international institutional standing, economic power and strategic dominance (at least in APAC&#x2F;MEA) has grown. Mainstream Western presses run night and day printing stories to support &quot;China bogeyman&quot; narrative staples like &quot;China virus&quot;, &quot;China debt trap diplomacy&quot;, &quot;China oppression&quot;, &quot;Foreign influence&quot;, &quot;Xinjiang genocide&quot;, &quot;HK freedom fighters&quot; to name a few currently popular ones.<p>Faced with this hostile international media environment what can China do? Domestically it must counteract and throw words-of-kind back, and diplomatically it has leant into the same. These are expected and required responses.<p>But the strange thing is, while it looks to be on the back foot, and while it may not be the sort of positive, glowing, appreciative and respectful international press coverage China might have dreamt of in its recent path of rapid growth, given that foreign presses and their audiences display an appetite for these stories, China might actually be serving its own interests by simply feeding those appetites and fanning the flames.<p>This sounds crazy. Why would China <i>want</i> the foreign press to gorge itself on anti-China stories and go off its rocker on &quot;China bad&quot;-conspiracy theories. Why would it be in China&#x27;s interests for people of other countries to receive this &quot;biased education&quot; about China? Why would China, if it had evidence, arguments, platforms and means to counter these narratives, not run its own operations night and day to paint a different picture?<p>I think there are a couple of advantages of what I&#x27;m proposing is a deliberate strategy, and there are certainly opportunities for China in the current hostile international media environment.<p>1. Controlled opposition. Once the &quot;rabid dog Western press&quot; has found its preferred China-hate narrative, it seems quite happy to continue munching on that big juicy bone and not letting it go. China could try to &quot;prize the bone from the mouth&quot;, but that will likely reinforce the rabid dog&#x27;s grip, no? Maybe a better strategy is to simply keep feeding the dog similar tasty tidbits and not reveal the &quot;tasty bone&quot; is actually rancid and expired (dog may not care, but hey), at least for now. In this way China achieves a measure of control of the anti-China stories. In this way China deftly turns the Western&#x27;s presses preferred appetite (and by some it&#x27;s perceived &quot;strength&quot;) into a vulnerability.<p>2a. Domestic mileage and protection. Chinese people might come across Western anti-China articles, which will only increase their proud nationalism and support any narratives the central government might want to launch about how biased and anti-China the western countries are. This incredible power actually insulates the central government from any foreign criticism, and weakens the ability of &quot;foreign adversaries&quot; to dislodge the Chinese government from their people (an likely impossible goal anyway, but many wedges have attempted to be inserted, no doubt to the amusement of regular Chinese who see foreigners trying to get Chinese to hate Chinese as a fool&#x27;s errand), because its so easy to dismiss the chorus of Western critics by how unhinged and hypocritical they are. The risk for China here is that it can insulate itself from internal legitimate critics, by the feintest association with &quot;crazy&quot; foreign ideas. So it will need to balance that insulation with practicality.<p>2b. Useful distraction. The loader and crazier the Western press and commentariat seems, the more China can allow such insanity to pierce its information control for useful effect. Bad press from provincial officials cramping the central government&#x27;s recent achievements style? A dash of &quot;China hate&quot; from the foreign press is sure to refocus netizen&#x27;s attention and bring people together in solidarity against external opposition. Again, the risk with this is China utilizes this massive power (of foreign hatred) too liberally to tune out of useful internal dissent. Given it&#x27;s rapid progress and stellar achievements I don&#x27;t think it seriously risks a lack of introspection, but the louder the Western &quot;evil CCP&quot; commentariat grows, the bigger this power grows, and so the bigger the risk that China might go overboard in using this domestically.<p>3. Future reveal payoffs. Just say China was manipulating foreign presses into printing anti-China narratives, but had bulletproof evidence against the claims (such as endless video evidence, investigations and interviews with people in Xinjiang, or legal arguments and foreign influence proof in HK, or a closest relative natural virus that originated in Italy in 2018), why would it hold off on providing that right now? Probably because the reasons above are so compelling and useful. China is interested in domestic narrative shaping and information control, and successfully achieves these objectives through many means. The above possibilities are useful tools that assist in this. But there&#x27;s another reason. A sort of &quot;kill shot&quot; to end the credibility of the Western press and paint China itself as &quot;unfairly and racistly persecuted victim&quot; (not altogether inaccurate). Say China brought out information (but didn&#x27;t reveal it had been sitting on it) to decisively end many of the anti-China claims, it would be able to constantly play that up to convince Westerners they can&#x27;t trust their own &quot;free press&quot;. A pretty strong card to have, particularly as soft-power will become more important as China&#x27;s influence ability grows. But not a card you&#x27;d need to play right now, not only because you&#x27;d miss out on the above. China can bide its time and watch the West score own-goals and commit unforced errors in its media game against China, that it can dredge up later to reveal Western incompetence and bias.<p>4. Catalysis for change. Say some place in China or some policy was an issue for the central government, but it was having a hard time cultivating the domestic momentum and provincial political will required for a successful change, what could it do? How could it utilize the current &quot;winds of chaos&quot; to assist it in its own goals? What if the West was directly inciting HK violence (or not involved, doesn&#x27;t matter here), and China knew, and allowed that to occur, until the time was right (and the justification big enough) for it to step in and change the law? Without every firing a single shot (itself), or ever sending in the troops (to do anything but clean up the roadway after people had departed). Guiding the winds of Western obsession and hate into the sails of a ship China is steering, could be a useful strategy for particularly challenging issues. All that Western press fanned those flames, blew those winds, puffed those sails --- to sail that ship right into China&#x27;s harbor. Pretty deft &quot;covert&quot; or &quot;paradoxical&quot; soft power. I think many of these issues are simply useful for reasons 1 - 3, but what other targets might be good candidates for this strategy? Xinjiang strategy needs a change, but is resisted by the elements who benefitted from version 1.1? Maybe. Need to send more people and money to build up naval supremacy in reefs and islands? Get the West to escalate its anti-rhetoric to show China how scared they are of that, and against China doing that, to lend support to it seeming like a good thing to do to counter Western projection, in that case. GZ or SZ having issues with provincial leaders, their cliques and ambitions? Seed some &quot;political oppression&quot; stories in the Western press to create a chaos and a grassroots movement for less central intervention, allow the movement to catch fire, then tie it to the South&#x27;s irresponsible leadership (and relative economic liberalism and Western links, for good measure) and use that to oust the provincial leaders as incompetent and complicit. It&#x27;s hard to think about these hypothetical candidates, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s many opportunities. Probably the flames of Western narratives can be used in some manner or another as part of larger strategies.<p>As China&#x27;s control and stability (and success) increases, its ability to deploy these strategies will diminish. But now seems like a good time and many opportunities, as the West eagerly lurches from one &quot;China-hate&quot; to the next. One risk is the West might wise up to this, and start trying to &quot;counter manipulate&quot; China, by feigning outrage at a non-issue or trying to force a Chinese concession by successfully cultivating an irrational populist narrative in a Chinese area that&#x27;s to drive a change that&#x27;s against Chinese interests. Time will tell if the West develops this strategic narrative sophistication. They&#x27;ve been on top for so long, they may have grown soft and uncritical, while China has had to grow clever in the hostile climate it found itself emerging in internationally. Of the West, in this, perhaps it&#x27;s like Bane says, &quot;Victory has defeated them.&quot; In the soft power sense, in these aspects, I think that&#x27;s partly true.",general,finance,

1323,2021-05-22,"I&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time on &#x27;bad science&#x27; as a topic lately (check my comment history or blog for some examples). I think what you&#x27;re proposing is the opposite of what&#x27;s required.<p>Firstly, the problem here is not an epidemic of scientists who feel too financially insecure to do good work. Many of the worst papers are being written by people with decades-long careers and who lead large labs. Their funding is very secure. They are doing bad work anyway for other reasons, sometimes political or ideological, more often because doing bad work results in attention, praise and power. Or sometimes because they don&#x27;t know how to explain their chosen question, but don&#x27;t want to admit that scientifically they failed and don&#x27;t know where to go next.<p>Secondly, as you already realized your proposal relies on identifying which scientists have a proven track record, but the whole problem is that science is flooded with fraudulent&#x2F;garbage claims which are highly cited (&quot;proven&quot;) and which were written by large teams of supposedly respectable scientists at supposedly respectable institutions. Any metric you can invent to decide who or what has a proven track record is going to be circular in this regard. To Rumsfeld the problem, we are surrounded by &quot;unknown knowns&quot;. You say this is an open question but to me that&#x27;s a fatal flaw.<p>So the problem is actually the inverse. You say at the end, well, scientists who can fund their own work are an exception. Obviously in most cases scientists don&#x27;t need to do this, they can also be funded by companies. Most computer science research works this way. Better CPUs and hardware is done almost entirely by companies. AI research has been driven by corporate scientists, and so on. In contrast academic funding comes primarily from government agencies that distribute money according to the desires of academics. This means a tiny number of people control large sums of money, and they are accountable to nobody except themselves. There are no systems or controls on academic behavior except peer review, which is largely useless because the peers are doing the same bad things as everyone else.<p>Viewed from an economic perspective academia is a planned reputation economy. The state is the source of all resource allocation decisions (academics being effectively state employees in most fields). There&#x27;s also a deeply embedded Marxist worldview: universities have no working mechanisms to detect fraud, because of an implicit assumption that deep down when market forces are gone everyone is automatically honest and good. The hierarchy is stagnant; the same institutions remain at the top for centuries. A good reputation lets them select the people with the reputation for being smart (e.g. by school grade), so that reputation accrues to the institutions, which lets them keep selecting intake by reputation and so on. Supposedly Oxford and Cambridge are the best UK universities, they always have been, and they always will be. In a competitive, free market economy they would face competition and other institutions would seek to figure out what their secret is and copy it, like how so many companies try to copy the Toyota Way. In science this doesn&#x27;t happen because there&#x27;s nothing to copy: these institutions aren&#x27;t actually different.<p>This implies a simple solution, just privatize it all. It would be wrenching, just like it was when the USSR transitioned to a market economy, just like it was when China (sort of) did the same. But one thing the 20th century teaches us is that you can&#x27;t really fix the problems of a planned economy by tinkering with small reforms at the edges. The Soviets weren&#x27;t able to fix their culture with glasnost and perestroika. They eventually had to give up on the whole thing. Replacing the current reputation economy with a real economy, with all the mechanisms that economic system has evolved (markets, prices, regulators, court cases, fraud laws etc), seems like a more direct and obvious approach to making things better, even if it may sound extreme.",general,general,

For example, the F-35 project, originally approved as a &quot;low-cost&quot; fighter, is built in 48 different US states, and is now the most expensive fighter plane ever built; yet still has over 600 potentially fatal design flaws.<p>Another current example is NASA&#x27;s SLS rocket, which if actually used is expected to cost fully 200x as much as a SpaceX Starship launch, for about the same cargo load.

The economic power of the US isn&#x27;t a product of it&#x27;s navy, rather it&#x27;s economic power is just another weapon it uses alongside military force.<p>Let&#x27;s look at how the petrodollar came about. The first step with the run on gold in 1971 which broke the Breton Woods system. The value of the dollar went through the floor. Having a big navy didn&#x27;t make any difference. This hurt oil exporters because now their dollar earning weren&#x27;t worth as much, but they didn&#x27;t abandon dollars.<p>Then in 1973 US support for Israel lead to the OPEC oil embargo. Oil prices quadrupled. You could say it was American military aid that caused this, well maybe but no actual projection of force by the US was involved. Military aid to Israel was no different in character from Soviet aid to Arab regimes. The reasons the embargo mattered and had an effect were economic reasons, not military ones.<p>When the United States-Saudi Arabian Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation was established in 1979 the US hadn&#x27;t invaded any Middle Eastern nation, hadn&#x27;t blockaded any Middle Eastern ports, hadn&#x27;t established any bases in the Middle East. The total of their interference was support for Israel, a small state a long way from any of the actual oil.<p>All three of those milestones were entirely economic in character. Military power projection played no part in them. The US has and uses economic power anyway, regardless of how effective it&#x27;s navy or army is. It was a military midget, but economic powerhouse in 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour. It parlayed that economic power into military might, not the other way around.

For this functions&#x2F;procedures are well suited, and so we also used procedures (sub-routines) as our structuring mechanism.  The problems we are solving with our computers have changed dramatically, but our structuring mechanism has remained essentially the same.<p>Another short:  software architecture defines many different kinds of connectors and components.  The procedure&#x2F;function call is just one of them, but that&#x27;s the one that is directly supported by the majority of our programming languages.

1762,2021-05-22,"I think this is backwards. The USSR had a navy toe-to-toe competitive with the US, but never had a fraction of the economic weight. The economic power of the US isn&#x27;t a product of it&#x27;s navy, rather it&#x27;s economic power is just another weapon it uses alongside military force.<p>Let&#x27;s look at how the petrodollar came about. The first step with the run on gold in 1971 which broke the Breton Woods system. The value of the dollar went through the floor. Having a big navy didn&#x27;t make any difference. This hurt oil exporters because now their dollar earning weren&#x27;t worth as much, but they didn&#x27;t abandon dollars. There was no credible alternative, and there was no military dimension to that fact.<p>Then in 1973 US support for Israel lead to the OPEC oil embargo. Oil prices quadrupled. You could say it was American military aid that caused this, well maybe but no actual projection of force by the US was involved. Military aid to Israel was no different in character from Soviet aid to Arab regimes. The reasons the embargo mattered and had an effect were economic reasons, not military ones.<p>When the United States-Saudi Arabian Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation was established in 1979 the US hadn&#x27;t invaded any Middle Eastern nation, hadn&#x27;t blockaded any Middle Eastern ports, hadn&#x27;t established any bases in the Middle East. The total of their interference was support for Israel, a small state a long way from any of the actual oil.<p>All three of those milestones were entirely economic in character. Military power projection played no part in them. The US has and uses economic power anyway, regardless of how effective it&#x27;s navy or army is. It was a military midget, but economic powerhouse in 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour. It parlayed that economic power into military might, not the other way around. By the end of the war the US was launching 2 aircraft carriers per month.<p>US military intervention in the Middle East long post-dates the establishment of the petro-dollar.

All is good.<p>* To avoid unnecessary re-rendering you’ll have to move callbacks into useCallback. These callbacks then also need to specify all of their dependencies. So many lines of code that are merely noise.<p>* They encourage having state locally in the component which often breaks down the moment you slightly tweak the design. So much refactoring!<p>* Dealing with any other (callback-based, stateful) API is confusing. If you want something to execute once initially you can use useEffect with an empty dependency list, but note that then there’s no way of accessing updates values (in callbacks) and everything will reflect the initial state. Often you’ll have to use useRef just to keep track of the current state. Or maybe useState?<p>* Debugging is painful. You forget one value in your dependency list and the weirdest things happen. Suddenly you have callbacks running in different rendering scopes with different values.<p>They feel very “brittle”: Once it works the code looks pretty, but when there’s a slight change of requirements you need to rethink everything.",web/mobile,general,

1791,2021-05-22,"This is unfortunately a widespread interpretation of Wittgenstien&#x27;s philosophy of mathematics, but it is not a very charitable reading.<p>Wittgenstein emphasised on numerous occasions (for example directly at the beginning of his lectures on the foundations of mathematics in 1939) that his interest in these proofs was _philosophical_ and that he never intended to criticise any of them _on mathematical grounds_. He explicitly said that his aim was not to interfere with mathematicians, but to investigate the _philosophical conclusions_ drawn by these mathematicians from their proofs.<p>What exactly Wittgenstein found problematic is hard to describe in a short comment, because much of it depends on Wittgenstein&#x27;s view of philosophy as a whole, but one example is the platonist bent of Gödel&#x27;s theorem and his conviction that there are some mathematical &quot;facts&quot; that can never be discovered by mathematical reason. Wittgenstein wants to ask what it means to say that something is &quot;intuitively true&quot;, but not provable in any consistent system, but he does not want to object to Gödel&#x27;s results, merely its &quot;standing&quot;.<p>In Cantor&#x27;s case Wittgenstein is interested in the concept of the transfinite and of infinities &quot;bigger&quot; than other infinities. He does not object to Cantor&#x27;s proof at all, but regards the philosophical conclusions drawn from it with suspicion.<p>(One good example of a philosophical abuse of Gödel&#x27;s theorem is the argument that computers will never be able to think like humans, because Gödel&#x27;s theorem demonstrates a limit to what any computer can do as a formal system, but we humans can nevertheless grasp the unprovable statements as intuitively true. This is basically the argument by J. R. Lucas. This is the kind of philosophical nonsense that Wittgenstein wanted to attack and his position on these matters is coincidentally quite similar to Turing&#x27;s position, who was a student of Wittgenstein&#x27;s lectures on the foundations of mathematics.)<p>It certainly did not help that the so-called Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics are in some parts highly selective constructions by the editors of his posthumous writings.<p>tl;dr: it&#x27;s complicated.

2017,2021-05-22,"&gt; you can&#x27;t design real-world systems that way in OOP languages<p>I <i>most</i> OOP languages. Out of many different languages which implement various interpretations of how OO should work, I found Io to be the purest, and for some odd reasons the most practical, implementation of object orientation.<p>In Io, you get two primitives: objects with slots and messages (which are also objects, of course). There&#x27;s literally nothing else in the language. There&#x27;s a bit of syntactic sugar, or rather, there <i>can</i> be a bit of syntactic sugar if you want, because the parser is an object you can customize on runtime, but otherwise it&#x27;s just objects and messages. Message contents can be passed by name (lazily), and you can transform messages in any way you want before they get send. Or after. Taken together, you get a run-time equivalent of Lisp macros (Io is also homoiconic, btw). Add to it the fact you can reify interpreter state as first-class objects, and you get incredibly expressive language based on extremely small set of concepts. I think allowing messages to be first-class values able to exist without specyfing a target is the key here. It&#x27;s also what Erlang does, with the difference being the sending and receiving messages in Erlang is hardcoded in BEAM, while it&#x27;s 100% customizable in Io.<p>My favourite example of the power of Io:<p><pre><code>    someObj someMsg(some, args)
</code></pre>
this is a simple message send. It will try to look up `someMsg` slot in the target `someObj`, will traverse the prototype chain if needed, and will activate the content of the slot if it&#x27;s a block of code.<p><pre><code>    someObj @(someMsg(some, args))  # outer parens optional
</code></pre>
this also a simple message send, where the message name is `@`. `@` is defined in `Object`, root of all prototype chains, and it: suspends evaluation of `someMsg`, saves a pair of `someObject`+`someMsg` in a queue in a Coroutine object and returns immediately. In other words, this time the message is delivered asynchronously, and executed the next time some Coroutine (including main) yields. It&#x27;s not a built-in primitive, you can implement `@` yourself pretty easily.<p>...anyway, when I hear about message passing, and think about it being &quot;done right&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;Io and Erlang&quot; that come to mind.

2062,2021-05-22,"&gt; you can&#x27;t design real-world systems that way in OOP languages<p>In <i>most</i> OOP languages. Out of many different languages which implement various interpretations of how OO should work, I found Io to be the purest, and for some odd reasons the most practical, implementation of object orientation.<p>In Io, you get two primitives: objects with slots and messages (which are also objects, of course). There&#x27;s literally nothing else in the language. There&#x27;s a bit of syntactic sugar, or rather, there <i>can</i> be a bit of syntactic sugar if you want, because the parser is an object you can customize on runtime, but otherwise it&#x27;s just objects and messages. Message contents can be passed by name (lazily), and you can transform messages in any way you want before they get send. Or after. Taken together, you get a run-time equivalent of Lisp macros (Io is also homoiconic, btw). Add to it the fact you can reify interpreter state as first-class objects, and you get incredibly expressive language based on extremely small set of concepts. I think allowing messages to be first-class values able to exist without specyfing a target is the key here. It&#x27;s also what Erlang does, with the difference being the sending and receiving messages in Erlang is hardcoded in BEAM, while it&#x27;s 100% customizable in Io.<p>My favourite example of the power of Io:<p><pre><code>    someObj someMsg(some, args)
</code></pre>
this is a simple message send. It will try to look up `someMsg` slot in the target `someObj`, will traverse the prototype chain if needed, and will activate the content of the slot if it&#x27;s a block of code.<p><pre><code>    someObj @(someMsg(some, args))  # outer parens optional
</code></pre>
this also a simple message send, where the message name is `@`. `@` is defined in `Object`, root of all prototype chains, and it: suspends evaluation of `someMsg`, saves a pair of `someObject`+`someMsg` in a queue in a Coroutine object and returns immediately. In other words, this time the message is delivered asynchronously, and executed the next time some Coroutine (including main) yields. It&#x27;s not a built-in primitive, you can implement `@` yourself pretty easily.<p>...anyway, when I hear about message passing, and think about it being &quot;done right&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;Io and Erlang&quot; that come to mind. Very different implementations, but they both work exceptionally well.",web/mobile,general,

Thank you for this.<p>I agree with you that the example of uncompensated prison labor under threat of solitary confinement is morally wrong.  I also agree that it at the very least skirts the line of slavery.<p>Where I think we (maybe?) disagree is that prison labor is not in and of itself slavery, nor morally wrong.  I&#x27;m not even sure that compelled labor is inappropriate as a sentence.  Under the right conditions, I tend to see compelled labor as an exemplary sentence because it&#x27;s less about punishment and more about the repayment of the proverbial debt to society.  My criteria for such compelled prison labor amount to:<p>1. The work should be acceptably safe, at least to common standards of occupational safety.<p>2. The work should be useful.  The goal is not to punish through toil, but to contribute to the collective.<p>3. The work should benefit the public.  It should not be in the service of a private entity.<p>I may be missing something obvious, but I think this more or less communicates what I have in mind.  As an example, I sometimes see inmates picking up litter on the side of the highway.  This strikes me as appropriate.<p>Overall, I find that people conflate the essence of prison labor with the modalities of prison labor.  Just because it&#x27;s implemented in a horrific an inhumane way doesn&#x27;t invalidate the general principle.  Similarly, the fact that prisons can be inhumane doesn&#x27;t invalidate the principle of depriving an individual of liberty after a fair trial.<p>It seems like there might be some common ground between us, here.

Some examples of the idea are react-grid-layout, golden-layout, react-mosaic. Each window can be minimized, maximized, moved, flashed, and closed ... all with flashy animations. You could create a whole bunch of components that allow you to capture all the different states and toggle them in different components, and effectively have the MDI business logic sprinkled all through out YOUR code, not just the &#x27;library&#x27; code. Alternatively, you could use a state machine that captures all the states in a single spot and manages that all efficiently and safely, you just call an api to trigger state changes throughout your code.<p>As some other comments have mentioned, this is a fundamental part of computer science. You can get by without knowing it cause you can write a bunch of ifs and state logic all over the place. If you only know how to use a hammer, ya you could still hammer a screw in. Understanding how different data structures of different patterns fit together provides you new tools to do things in different ways when appropriate.

2327,2021-05-22,"This reminds me of the recent post linked on HN about &quot;why it&#x27;s a bad idea to write books.&quot;<p>One thing I think people miss is that founding a startup, or working at an early-stage startup, belongs to a class of financially irrational aspirations that includes other things like rock-star, novelist, actor, and professional athlete.  For all these careers, the financial rewards are distributed according to a power law. A few superstars take a massively disproportionate share of rewards while the expected ROI is negative across all aspirants.<p>I stress &quot;financial&quot; rewards because for many of these pursuits there are intangible rewards that make it worth it even for the &quot;losers&quot;.  I spent most of my 20s playing in rock bands and legitimately trying, and failing, to &quot;make it&quot;. During that time I had a day job, so I was working constantly either at the band or at my day job, and really not doing much else.  I wouldn&#x27;t trade that time in my life for anything, despite the fact that it cost me money both out-of-pocket and in opportunity cost, and only perhaps a few hundred people now remember my band.  On the other hand, I had no family to support during that time, and I was willing to live a low-rent bohemian lifestyle.<p>Early-stage startups are probably the same: the camaraderie, the esprit-de-corps, and the joy of building things are the reward.<p>It&#x27;s important to enter into these risky pursuits with your eyes open and understand that the most important rewards you receive won&#x27;t be financial. If those intangibles aren&#x27;t important to you, or if the base level of financial security you need is higher than that of a bohemian lifestyle, then you should look for something else.",finance,finance,

2331,2021-05-22,"&gt; you can&#x27;t design real-world systems that way in OOP languages<p>In <i>most</i> OOP languages. Out of many different languages which implement various interpretations of how OO should work, I found Io to be the purest, and for some odd reasons the most practical, implementation of object orientation.<p>In Io, you get two primitives: objects with slots and messages (which are also objects, of course). There&#x27;s literally nothing else in the language. There&#x27;s a bit of syntactic sugar, or rather, there <i>can</i> be a bit of syntactic sugar if you want, because the parser is an object you can customize on runtime, but otherwise it&#x27;s just objects and messages. Message contents can be passed by name (lazily), and you can transform messages in any way you want before they get send. Or after. Taken together, you get a run-time equivalent of Lisp macros (Io is also homoiconic, btw). Add to it the fact you can reify interpreter state as first-class objects, and you get incredibly expressive language based on extremely small set of concepts. I think allowing messages to be first-class values able to exist without specyfing a target is the key here. It&#x27;s also what Erlang does, with the difference being the sending and receiving messages in Erlang is hardcoded in BEAM, while it&#x27;s 100% customizable in Io.<p>My favourite example of the power of Io:<p><pre><code>    someObj someMsg(some, args)
</code></pre>
this is a simple message send. It will try to look up `someMsg` slot in the target `someObj`, will traverse the prototype chain if needed, and will activate the content of the slot if it&#x27;s a block of code.<p><pre><code>    someObj @(someMsg(some, args))  # outer parens optional
</code></pre>
this also a simple message send, where the message name is `@`. `@` is defined in `Object`, root of all prototype chains, and it: suspends evaluation of `someMsg`, saves a pair of `someObject`+`someMsg` in a queue in a Scheduler object and returns immediately. In other words, this time the message is delivered asynchronously, and executed the next time some Coroutine (including main) yields. It&#x27;s not a built-in primitive, you can implement `@` yourself pretty easily.<p>...anyway, when I hear about message passing, and think about it being &quot;done right&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;Io and Erlang&quot; that come to mind. Very different implementations, but they both work exceptionally well.",web/mobile,general,

Instead the ethics of science and culture need to be organized around ecological ethics: the reality of planetary stewardship is the challenge of the Anthropocene.

2487,2021-05-22,"One of the advantages of TCE in Logo (in combination with turtle graphics) is that you can teach the concept of recursion in a gradual and intuitive manner.

     fd 3
     rt 7
     circle
    end
</code></pre>
Add a parameter, and get a spiral. The turtle winds its way off the screen, and again the student can stop the program manually:<p><pre><code>    to spiral :x
     fd :x
     rt 30
     spiral (:x + 1)
    end
</code></pre>
Introduce a base-case, and now the program stops itself at a desired size:<p><pre><code>    to spiral :x
     if (:x = 30) [ stop ]
     fd :x
     rt 30
     spiral (:x + 1)

Small, unsurprising steps building up an intuitive grasp of a useful concept.<p>TCE can also improve the economy of the language, reducing the number of &quot;primitive&quot; control flow concepts that need to be provided out of the box. Since Logo has no &quot;special forms&quot; and is not eagerly evaluated like a Lisp, it&#x27;s easy to make new control constructs without needing to teach any magic:<p><pre><code>    to while :cond :proc

2620,2021-05-23,"There is such flags as -fwrapv which I use in programs that I think may need it.<p>Maybe, there should be another flag which defines or partially defines many more things. For example, shift amounts out of range might produce any numerical answer (without other side effects), or it might trap once that operation is reached and not give any answer at all, but not demons in your nose or anything like that; either way, the compiler might or might not display a warning message. This is similar to what is mentioned in the linked document.<p>Another alternative flag might be used to guarantee terminating with an error message in such a case, making the program execute more slowly (because the compiler will insert such a check), for testing purposes perhaps. The document linked mentions such a case, but I think that it should not be the default case.<p>If you have:<p><pre><code>  int x[3];
  int*y=x+1;
  int*z=x-1;
</code></pre>
Then, what I think is how it should work, should be:<p>- The program itself is valid.<p>- The pointers y and z are unequal; if you write y!=z then it is guaranteed to be true.<p>- Reading or writing through z should be considered as undefined behaviour and not allowed. The compiler can optimize based on the assumption that it doesn&#x27;t happen, unless that optimization is disabled, or if the program is changed to specify it as volatile (in which case it remains undefined behaviour, but the compiler can no longer assume this when optimizing).<p>- Since z is out of range, comparing if it is less or greater than y is not predictable.<p>- Since z is out of range, there is no guarantee that it is 
unequal to any other pointer that isn&#x27;t based on x, including null; it might or might not be null.<p>- If you write z+=2 then z is now in range and z==y is true and you can read&#x2F;write through z now.<p>If you write:<p><pre><code>  static int f(void) {
    int a;
    return a;
  }

  int main(int argc,char**argv) {
    int x=42;
    x=f();
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,x);
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,x);
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,x);
    return 0;
  }
</code></pre>
Then it should be: The return value of f() will be some value for each call (not necessarily the same every time), and can optimize it. Since the function does nothing, and the return value is not defined, it is allowed to optimize out the reassignment to x and always print 42, or it can set x to some other value, which is unpredictable and not necessarily the same every time, but not print three different numbers, trap, or do other stuff. If standard library optimizations are enabled (which they might be by default, depending on the compiler), it may optimize out the entire program and replace it with a constant string and printing it, as long as it is a number and line feed, repeated three times with the same number, which must be in range of the int type. It may also compile the program like it is and when the program is executed multiple times, print different numbers different times, but always three same numbers. Printing nothing is not allowed, since the %d format specifier can never result in nothing; it always results in at least one digit.",web/mobile,general,

Basking Rootwalla can be played for free whenever you discard it. (Which you can do via the Bazaar.) Bloodghast will come out of your graveyard whenever you play a land. Hollow One can be played for free as long as you&#x27;ve discarded 3 cards. (Luckily, that&#x27;s the exact amount of discarding provided by the Bazaar.) Hogaak can be played out of your graveyard as long as you have two creatures already in play.

If you can play a Deathrite Shaman or a Stitcher&#x27;s Supplier, those will count too, but this is not a necessary part of the plan.)<p>- Vengevine has haste, so whenever you do manage to get one out, it can attack immediately. It has been the core threat of various decks in the past.<p>- If you can get 3 Bloodghasts and 2 Hogaaks into your graveyard, you can recur all of your Vengevines just by playing a land.

It doesn&#x27;t matter how good or bad the documentation of implementation-defined behavior may or may not be; the important part is that compilers cannot optimize under the assumption that control flow paths containing implementation-defined behavior are never reached.

That is what &quot;the standard imposes no requirements&quot; means.<p>I think you&#x27;re mixing standardese-undefined-behavior with colloquial-undefined-behavior here.

It all has the same problem: the distance between the hypothesis, the experimental manipulation, and the measurement is large and badly understood. Differences between conditions are then ascribed to noise, which enables &quot;creative&quot; interpretations of the results.<p>As an example: in the field in which I worked, it was commonly assumed that the processing mechanism had to interpret a part of the stimulus as belonging to one thing or the other. Then they would manipulate the context to see how they could influence that. There were many results and experimental refinements, leading to an endless stream of contradictory articles, all claiming victory for their theory. But there are models in which this assumption doesn&#x27;t make sense. Instead, it could belong to both, and the ambiguity would be resolved later. That makes the whole research line I described nonsense. The data is valid (if well documented), but the analyses and conclusions are not.<p>A genetics statistician explained to me that all early genetic research (and that means up until 2000 at least) is highly unreliable, because they used Neyman-Fisher significance testing with high p values, like 0.01. The lack of understanding was (and probably still is) so great, that 0.01 was simply not enough to exclude random results. Nearly all those papers are irreproducible. Nowadays, 5 sigma, which is less than 0.000001, is considered safe, although he himself was convinced that Bayesian is the only way to go.<p>The understanding of the subject in psychology is considerably worse than in biology.

This is less than optimal for lots of reasons: duplication of metadata, inefficient query plans, no foreign keys, inability to use most kinds of indexes effectively, etc...<p>However, the need is real: the ability to easily extend or generate table schemas without having to switch languages. You can argue that this is &quot;not that hard&quot;, but you&#x27;d be absolutely wrong. It&#x27;s <i>obscenely difficult</i>. I&#x27;ve tried, failed, and have given up. One use-case I had was automatically generating tables for importing data from PowerShell. My goal was to be able to write something like this:<p><pre><code>    Get-Process | Export-Sql -ConnectionString &#x27;...&#x27; -TableName &#x27;Processes&#x27;
</code></pre>
And have the &quot;Export-Sql&quot; command <i>automatically</i> generate the table schema on the fly based on the input columns it sees. I even wanted to be able to represent object hierarchies as sets of related tables with parent-child foreign key relationships automatically put in. I got a proof-of-concept working, but there were just too many edge-cases. Things like maximum lengths for key or index columns, maximum row size, inability to switch column types on the fly, etc...<p>So what to do other people do? They also give up and resort to defining a single table that has the columns: &quot;TableName, RowId, ColumnName, ColumnValue&quot; and call it a day. I mean... what other <i>options</i> are there? Bang your head against the wall for months trying to deal with idiotic things like identifier length limits? Correctly escaping arbitrary input strings? Generating hundreds of distinct commands that <i>cannot</i> be parametrised and <i>hope</i> you don&#x27;t have a SQL injection vulnerability lurking in there somewhere? It&#x27;s nuts!<p>Have you seen just how much code it takes to take an <i>arbitrary</i> table, one with dozens of foreign key references, several filtered multi-column indexes, and views that depend on it, and then <i>insert</i> a column in a specific position? You have to drop everything, copy the table, rename, and then recreate everything. Doing this in code would be... I dunno... a few hundred thousand lines? That&#x27;s <i>absurd</i>. You&#x27;re not doing it. I&#x27;m not doing it. Microsoft did it once for SQL Server Management Studio, and I bet they&#x27;re not rewriting that code in a hurry!<p>But go back to the &quot;bad&quot; schema example before: Is it <i>really</i> that bad? What if the database engine had the ability to store common prefixes just once, instead of repeating them for each row? What if the schema looked like this:<p><pre><code>    Database, Owner, Table, Column, Value
</code></pre>
Starting to look familiar? A bit like [server].[database].[dbo].[Table] perhaps, familiar to every user of Microsoft SQL Server?<p>There&#x27;s a natural hierarchy for describing the data, that lends itself well to being represented as a B-Tree, along with the data itself! That&#x27;s what the &quot;bad&quot; schema is doing: it&#x27;s representing the data with the most <i>natural</i> representation! It&#x27;s not wrong at all!<p>The problem is that database engines have all sorts of features and optimisations that we want that isn&#x27;t directly compatible with the naive implementation of the bad schema. Constraints, foreign keys, efficient storage, indexing, etc...<p>However, none of these features are fundamentally incompatible with an API that merely &quot;pretends&quot; that the data is stored in a single flat list that can have its schema updated with a simple insert. The database engine could simply factor out the schema part and the data part into different <i>physical</i> storage layouts, with all the usual efficiencies such as not having to repeat column names for every row.<p>To summarise: we could have our cake and eat it too. Database engines could be developed that use ordinary select&#x2F;insert&#x2F;delete&#x2F;update statements to modify the schema, <i>and</i> have it perform just as efficiently as a database that uses clumsy statements like &quot;alter table add column&quot;.

We started by playing fun games at bedtime where he would give me instructions for various things such as how to leave his bedroom and I would follow them literally  - resulting in my bashing into walls, falling over etc. He soon got the hang of being accurate with his instructions. He then moved on to building simple games using Scratch but got bored with that pretty quickly. He started to spend a lot of time playing Minecraft and would watch YouTube videos showing him how to make redstone circuits etc. He wanted to make his own games and so he gave Unity a try but the learning material wasn’t quite accessible to a (then) 8 year old. About a year ago he started playing Roblox and within weeks had downloaded Roblox Studio (Roblox’s development environment) and had begun making his own games. I think Minecraft helped him a lot with his ability to create 3D environments within Roblox but they also have a library of free, pre-rigged and pre-scripted models which removes any barrier to entry. He started making his first games entirely out of free models. He learned to script in Lua by watching other kids Roblox scripting videos on YouTube. He’s just turned 10 now and has a firm grasp of fundamental programming concepts, released several games and has begun releasing his own coding tutorials on YouTube.

The salary they get can easily exceed Google L4 total pay (e.g. in the UK and in Germany, not to mention in most other countries). Of course, many companies such as GitLab aggressively adjust their salary according to where you work from, but I&#x27;ve seen more and more companies that don&#x27;t. It will be very interesting to see how the market sorts itself out in a few years&#x27; time: Seems to me the proliferation of remote work could result in US salary and remote salary meeting somewhere in the middle.",job/career,general,

This hits on the crux of problem for me: the continually and arbitrarily moving goal posts.<p>The thing is, people like me never did care. When I was in school it was a thing to call people&#x2F;things &quot;gay&quot; as a sign of disapproval, but as soon as I became an adult I stopped that and actually met some gay people, some of which became friends. But ultimately I&#x27;ve always felt the same way about all private matters: it&#x27;s none of my business and I just don&#x27;t care. Hell, I don&#x27;t even have the spare brain capacity to care. I just can&#x27;t do it.<p>One of the arguments that used to be made about being gay is that it&#x27;s not a choice. I never found this a convincing argument. In my view, I don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s a choice or not. It&#x27;s still your choice to make. So I think I was progressive even back then.<p>But now it&#x27;s changed. It&#x27;s no longer about not caring but, rather, people like me should care, for some reason. I get that if this was a human rights or civil liberties issue, but it&#x27;s not. We&#x27;re past that. So why, then, is &quot;gay pride&quot; a thing, if not to push what should be a private issue into people&#x27;s faces? Why is it in the workplace? You don&#x27;t have sex at work so why do I need to know that you&#x27;re gay? How does that help achieve our goals?<p>Not caring is now demonised. The goal posts just keep moving. If there were concrete issues that haven&#x27;t been considered then I&#x27;m all ears. But I really don&#x27;t hear them.

They can read the stuff at home, and have ~2 hours extra per week to do other stuff.<p>We have 1:1 tutoring 2 per week (students have to get an online ticket), and they can also ask us privately per email, but in my experience, students that are &quot;too shy&quot; to go to class and ask questions in front of others are also often &quot;too shy&quot; to asks questions privately.<p>The other aspect of these is homeworks. Our homeworks allow groups, but they are thought of as &quot;individual homeworks&quot;. We recommend people do them on their own. This means that non-shy people as a group get them done faster and often better, but it also means that shy people doing them on their own, end up learning more and performing better in the exams.<p>We don&#x27;t grade homeworks, just pass or not pass, but passing them is required to be allowed to take the exam.<p>Still, we do internally grade them, and people that do them well alone do perform better in the exam.<p>---<p>In my opinion, the only &quot;downside&quot; for &quot;shy&quot; students, is that since we give them the freedom to not attend _any_ classes, they might decide not to do so. That means, no access to new friends, new colleagues, in person learning groups, isolation, and well understanding the hardest parts of the material might cost them more time if they are &quot;on their own&quot;.<p>Most still make it.

They too easily allow mistakes to hide in plain sight, the programmer writes ++n where they actually needed n++ or vice versa, and a reviewer&#x27;s brain overlooks this and so it gets shipped.<p>If you&#x27;re playing Code Golf then these operators are a big benefit, but we aren&#x27;t playing Code Golf, we&#x27;re writing actual software that will be used in the real world, so explicitly spelling out what you meant is <i>good</i>.<p>As a result some modern languages deliberately do not have these operators. And e.g. as I understand it Swift actually <i>removed</i> these operators from the language. But C++ 20 still has both operators of course, it&#x27;s just that your local dialect might forbid one or both of them.",web/mobile,finance,

3285,2021-05-23,"I would think it&#x27;s really in Amazon&#x27;s interest to crack down on fakes. Fakes are bad customer experience.<p>My guess is that fakes are hard to detect at Amazon&#x27;s operational scale - that it&#x27;s &quot;not solved&quot; how to filter or curate out shrewd fakes vendors and ads for fakes on the platform at scale.  The Amazon market place is like an AppStore without the benefit of code to scan.<p>Amazon does need to signal that they are going to detect the fake sellers. But I also think that they would benefit by implementing a more restrictive listings policy, where they risk some false positives in favor of reducing the overall prevalance of fakes.  This is one of the things that makes the AppStore frustrating for publishers to deal with, but it also in principal benefits the Apple customer. A low restriction policy instead favors vendor relationships vs consumer experience. Maybe Amazon benefits by identifying customers with a propensity to buy goods like fakes.<p>One would think Amazon is losing consumers for certain goods.  Amazon operates a marketplace. It makes money from sellers, in terms of selling paying to advertise, and it makes money from transactions, as some fraction of sales.  It instruments the marketplace, so it knows which consumers are  buying which goods.  It makes money from its own brands, which given its instrumentation, can efficiently targetly pockets of demand.<p>Amazon does OK as long as it is the default or preferred marketplace for stuff.  As a consumer, I should not be seeing fake stuff at all. This is a search quality problem, like not seeing SEO&#x27;d spam in search results.  If it&#x27;s hard to tell good stuff from fake stuff, you would think a  BestBuy or a Walmart with assured quality would win out.<p>What it looks like now is that not &quot;enough&quot; consumers are turned off from negative Amazon experiences.
Do I pay a lower price though a more convenient experience, and risk a notably worse fake, or do I pay a little more, and go to a differernt vendor? I wonder if there is a relative or absolute cost charactic to fakes - like no deal can be but so good and probably not be a fake.  What I would want to see is if Amazon is losing sales on higher cost higher risk items to competitors.<p>I think the ultimate question for undestanding Amazon will always be the money - how are the marketplace profits are driven - and in that what&#x27;s the mix of vendor ads, transaction fees, and consumer targeting. My speculation is that they are working toward technical solutions for fakes, and that they think they have time and position in market to get there.

3401,2021-05-23,"To start, I appreciate the long and thought out answer. You’ve put some effort in, and it was a pleasant and interesting read<p>However, I think you’ve misunderstood BLM at its core. BLM is not a specific group like the GOP or the NRA. Maybe it was originally, and maybe it nominally still is, but BLM is a slogan. It’s a label. It’s more like calling yourself left-wing, or right-wing.<p>If I say I’m left-wing, do you assume I have the same views as the people who sat on the left wing of the French parliament all those years ago?<p>So if I say “Black Lives Matter”, should you assume that I believe the same as some nameless, faceless founder that I don’t know?<p>Just to add a bit of real life evidence to that, I don’t know if you’ve met the kind of people that associate themselves with black lives matter, but being a student, I have, a lot. They have no interest in Marxism, let me tell you<p>And in regards to your comment that Marxism isn’t economic: I don’t like to directly call people wrong, because it’s abrasive and rarely changes anything, but no, you’re completely wrong.<p>Marxism is primarily about the distribution of wealth in society. The name of the book is ‘Das Kapital’. It’s not ‘Das Identity’, or ‘Das Oppressors’. It’s ‘The Capital’. It’s a book analysing who holds the money and means of production in society and how that capital is distributed amongst the classes. Marx was an economist.<p>and I take your point that if you extrapolate some of Marx’s views outwards, they could be applied to what blm people stand for. However, that is not marxism. That is one aspect of Marxism, extrapolated outwards and applied to something different.<p>Look at it this way: 
Plenty of right-wing anti-semites believe that the world is secretly oppressed by a small minority of jews. Would you call them Marxists, or neo-marxists?<p>Now finally, onto your parallels between the silicon valley ideology that’s risen up and Marxism. First of all, there’s an inherent extremely obvious contradiction. Silicon valley is full of massive capital holding corporations, who aggressively crush any attempts to unionise, who are the antithesis of marx’s primary goals. Even if the ideology shares some vague themes with communism, in my opinion, that is easily enough to scratch off a Marxist label. Easily.<p>Onto your actual parallels: 
1. this is just a repeat of above. Sure it’s true, and sure it’s a parallel, but it’s nowhere near enough to start throwing round the word marxist<p>2. that may have been an aspect of communist societies, but it’s also an aspect of fascist societies, and basically any society who had something to hide. Besides, we’re talking about Marxism, not in-practice communism<p>3. First, Marx’s feud wasn’t with imperialism, it was with the class system. I’m sure he didn’t like imperialism either, but that wasn’t his primary enemy. Anyway, that’s beside the point. I’ve never heard anything like that from a BLM or new left&#x2F;silicon valley type. They’re very interested in short term aesthetic wins (pulling down statues, apologies from politicians etc etc) and I really don’t think many of them have considered their long-term goals. This is a conversation I’ve had a few times. I posit that surely the end-goal should be to, outside of practicalities, forget race&#x2F;gender&#x2F;sexuality even exists in the first place, and they aren’t really sure and don’t seem to have thought about it<p>Additionally, achieving your goals and converting the world to your mindset is not an invention of Marx, and not even remotely exclusive to marxists<p>4. this also is hardly unique to the ideology, or to Marxism, or any group. the Nazis were the same. So are the Westboro baptist church. Are they Marxists?<p>To take the WBC point further, look at those parallels again. How many of them apply to the Westboro Baptist Church, or the Nazis, or most cults?<p>You may think that’s against my argument, but it’s not. I’m not here to defend the new left or BLM. They do share some themes with cults and bad groups from history, and I think their ideology is borderline madness. (read up on critical race theory). That doesn’t make them Marxists though.

COVID vaccines have been shown to prevent infection...<p>and cited a link which stated that<p>&gt; &quot;... two mRNA vaccines can reduce the risk of all SARS-CoV-2 infections, not just symptomatic infections.&quot;<p>So, the vaccines reduce the risk of being the virus being present, as well as the risk that the virus being present will cause symptoms (and by implications, the risk of severe symptoms).<p>Your link uses the term &quot;infection&quot; to cover both:<p><pre><code>   * virus present, no symptoms

I doubt it had anything to do with hostility towards repairability because this car is easily repairable. This came down to the design requirements for the car and particularly the engine they wanted to use to satisfy those design requirements.<p>Long gone are the days when you could sit in an engine bay to work on it because there was that much free room. Modern vehicles have to comply with many regulations, e.g. emissions and safety, whilst simultaneously meeting consumer demands at a price point people will accept. Without knowing the exact model of car you have, I&#x27;d say your shift solenoid problem almost certainly comes down to component sourcing - the manufacturer either uses this transmission in a number of vehicles or it&#x27;s procured from someone else - and manufacturability&#x2F;supply chain optimization - it&#x27;s easier to integrate an already integrated solution^[4]. There might also be other considerations such as space availability, weight distribution (since you said you had to pull the engine to get to it), environmental, and efficiency.

This is a work the author had to pay no matter if the final goal was Kubernetes, Autoscale Groups or any other solution.<p>Then the author explains how they got to the conclusion that they need to containerise their service(s) in order to be able to use K8s, which would then, in turn, allow them to scale properly (adding on top the Go rewrite that is mentioned at some point in the post).
The author also explains that Autoscale Groups were discarded because of their complexity.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that K8s was the actual thing that helped them scale, but rather the work they put into reworking their services. In my experience, once your service(s) are ready to be deployed in servers that can be managed as cattle, the benefits show up independently of the deployment solution that is used to deploy the service(s) (K8s, Autoscale Groups, etc...).<p>Just to add on my point, wouldn&#x27;t the result (in terms of performance &#x2F; resources usage) be the same if instead of &quot;containers&quot; the author had chosen &quot;AMIs&quot; and instead of &quot;Kubernetes&quot; the author had opted for &quot;Autoscale Groups&quot;?<p>If that were the case (which I believe it might have), the other thing to consider would be the difficulty of managing a K8s cluster vs the difficulty of managing an Autoscale Group.

3523,2021-05-23,"Let me do my best to convey some potential concerns. To say that they’re all GMO so what’s the problem is sort of either an ignorant or disingenuous overloading of the term. Sexual reproduction in a way sort of fits with that category (I mean it’s just selective breeding crowdsourced). But if we restrict GMO to only mutations, yeah there are actually legitimate issues.<p>Mutations occur naturally, and overtime nature has evolved methods to withstand this. Like the one thing that all organisms share, DNA-wise, is the code to faithfully copy DNA. You literally never see mutations in this code because nothing survives. Beyond that we do see random mutations all the times, but they’re usually harmful or at best don’t do much. Then occasionally there are beneficial mutations but they’re very rare and they happen over long periods of time. Atomic gardening is using this exact process albeit speeding it up bu increasing the speed that mutations occur.<p>On the other hand, genetic engineering is selective in a way that there is no natural precedent for. We literally have no idea if it’s not harmful or not. I’m not trying to say this to sound alarmist I just mean philosophically speaking you can’t prove that.<p>I’ll add as an aside that I don’t think the condescension that you see all the time regarding GMO is a food faith argument. There are plenty of scientific reasons to give pause to testing this stuff out in production.<p>As to concrete, practical reasons why we should give pause before engineering life with such wild abandon, I’d say recombinant DNA is one, but also so is the danger of just good ok’ mono-crops.<p>Now let me explain that I’m not personally and categorically anti-GMO. I think it’s wonderful technology that we can do so much with. I just think it’s dumb for people who don’t have degrees in genetics to go on the internet and say that people who have any concerns are “amusing” or stupid or whatever because science. The truth is it all depends abd there’s absolutely zero reason to think the GMO can’t go horribly wrong as some kind of rule.<p>I’m on my phone so some of this may read weird but I hope my point comes across as I meant it. Basically science is a philosophical branch rooted in skepticism.<p>One last thing I’ll say is there’s a bit of selection bias happening. You never hear from scientist who raise legitimate concerns because industry has a huge influence in people’s ability to do research and this their careers.<p>So in summary, mutations happen all the time in nature. Some “good” some “bad”. There are dangers but there’s been billions or years of evolution to buffer against it. Targeted genetic engineering like CRISPR is only the same un that there’s mutations but that’s where the similarities end. Like natural mutations they can be good or bad. There’s nothing unscientific or amusing about giving a second thought if maybe there are additional differences yet to be seen downstream. To say otherwise is categorically unscientific. We should absolutely proceed with caution and there are absolutely problems like the ones I listed. I mean, many of the people here are programmers.

3590,2021-05-24,"&gt; It&#x27;s really odd to me Lua is only used for games. It could take the same place Python has and many other things. It&#x27;s a nice platform for scripting.<p>I’ve written quite a bit of code in Fennel [1], a Lisp language which compiles to Lua, and enjoyed thoroughly the simplicity of Lua. I implemented map, filter and reduce by hand using Lua tables and genuinely experienced joy with how Lua tables are such a unifying concept throughout the language. I even enjoyed 1-based array indexing after a short while.<p>(Furthermore, I have to say Lua is meant to be a Lisp, insofar as homoiconicity is the simplest language syntax, and being Lua underneath removes all the esoterica from Lisp, making the end result even simpler.)<p>But Lua was designed from the very beginning with the assumption it would be embedded within a systems programming language like C. Lua lacks basic functionality other, more full-featured scripting languages ship support for out of the box, e.g. Lua doesn’t even have mkdir. Also, once you survey the landscape for argument parsing in Lua, or cross-platform statically linked binary compilation in Lua, you realize the Lua ecosystem itself expects you to be using Lua as an embedded scripting language.<p>I was able to get really far embedding Fennel in Rust, for example [2]. Rust is miles ahead of Lua in all the areas Lua is lacking. Instead of clumsily tacking on an object system on top of Lua, write Rust structs. Or instead of using ancient libraries for cross-platform filesystem and IO handling, leverage the native Rust ecosystem (see: dirs-next, clap).<p>My idea was to just embed Fennel in Rust, and write almost no Rust. And while it does certainly work, I’m increasingly of the belief you should use the language best for the task. Lua is best at being an embedded scripting language, good when you want to ship an interpreter on top of a C&#x2F;Rust application for instance, or when you want something fancier than TOML or INI for config.<p>(In this department, see also the work being done on Starlark in the Bazel ecosystem [3].)<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fennel-lang.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fennel-lang.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;~ioiojo&#x2F;include-fnl"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;~ioiojo&#x2F;include-fnl</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookexperimental&#x2F;starlark-rust"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookexperimental&#x2F;starlark-rust</a>",web/mobile,finance,

He opened that shop decades ago, pays the bills, does the bookkeeping, opens the doors every morning, closes them at night. He is a capitalist, and he is a worker.<p>Obviously I’ve never looked at his books, but I imagine that he pays himself a salary and that the business has been saving most of what was left over after that, since it’s been a hard year and he hasn’t gone out of business.

Instagram is also a direct sales channel for Indonesian, Thai, and Sri Lankan growers, who often don’t speak English well but know how to tag the photos of their crops in English, so you can search the hashtags and get daily photos of ready stock.

People post what they’re looking for, and do sales and swaps and even arrange transportation for newly purchased plants (i.e. if you’re going from Livermore to Palo Alto mid-week, can you bring my philodendron).

Detailed how-to videos, propagation experiments, tours of rare plant nurseries and stores, and many people use that content to drive traffic to their own store or to promote their favorite stores.

So on-shell non-Starlink satellite relays it is for now. If there is more than one relay, any orbit might be fine [**]. If it really has to be a single relay satellite for some reason, a <i>polar</i> lunar orbit might be a possible solution that does not suffer from regular communications blackouts. Another solution might be to relax the requirement of having a continuous connection between the single relay satellite and Earth and to accept to be offline for a fraction of the orbit (at an orbital height of ~500km above Moon a satellite would disappear for a bit over a quarter of its orbital period behind Moon).<p>One thing: at no point, Earth&#x27;s Starlink satellites are involved.

They have not gone well, and while Gates has always had the ability to walk away from these projects unscathed, not everyone has been so lucky.<p>&gt; At the beginning of the new millennium, Gates decided that perhaps breaking large schools into smaller schools might yield some improvements. Gates spent billions of dollars piloting programs, creating thousands of small schools across the country and ultimately walking away from the project when he decided that it wasn’t producing results. What’s important to note that not only did Gates decide what kinds of structural changes he was paying for, and not only did he leave many districts to figure out what to do next with the half-finished experiment that was their community school system, but Gates also set the terms for what a successful school would look like. You might be able to think of many benefits to having your child in a smaller school, but Gates only looked at three—attendance, college enrollment, and scores on a math and reading test.<p>&gt; These are factors that can be reduced to data, and data has been a singular focus of Gatesian reform. If data is the new oil, then public schools are the new Texas. The Foundation put at least $100 million into inBloom, a massive project intended to mine data from students and staff at schools. Somehow, backers failed to anticipate that there would be considerable resistance to the idea, and inBloom ended as a massive failure.<p>&gt; The next Gates project was an attempt to improve the teaching profession through training, hiring and evaluation. Again, a mountain of money was spent, and again, the project was ultimately judged a failure—in part, because it did not raise student scores on standardized reading and math scores. And again, the Gates Foundation walked away from the program; Hillsborough School District in Florida was one system left holding a multi-million dollar bag.<p>&gt; Of course, the most infamous Gates education project was the Common Core State Standards. Gates did not invent the Core, but as detailed by Lyndsey Layton in 2014, he provided financial backing, organization, and sheer clout to swiftly push them into every state in the nation. The amount of money that Gates spent to support the Core is hard to know exactly—the sheer number of groups and size of the checks written is staggering. But Gates spending on US education involves billions of dollars and has directly influenced how trillions of taxpayer dollars have been spent. And while some still argue that the Core was a success, it would be hard to find any broad-based agreement.<p>Perhaps what&#x27;s broken in education is that people with money and political power think they know how to educate better than educators do, and have more control over education policy?<p>Or, switching to health, and quoting from <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;opinion-the-world-loses-under-bill-gates-vaccine-colonialism&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;opinion-the-world-loses-under-bi...</a> :<p>&gt; Throughout the last two decades, Gates has repeatedly advocated for public health policies that bolster companies’ ability to exclude others from producing lifesaving drugs, including allowing the Gates Foundation itself to acquire substantial intellectual property.

Another solution might be to relax the requirement of having a continuous connection between the single relay satellite and Earth and to accept to be offline for a fraction of the orbit (at an orbital height of ~500km above Moon(&#x27;s equator) a satellite would disappear behind Moon for a bit over a quarter of its orbital period), so if approximately 73% availability is fine, this would also work. Higher inclinations improve this value.<p>One more thing because this also seemed unclear: at no point are Earth&#x27;s Starlink satellites involved. All moving of data between Earth and Moon happens between the dedicated relay satellite(s) and a ground station on Earth, as this is the setup that NASA used for its laser optical communications test that I linked to from my other posting.<p>All in all, that means that (under the assumption that Starlink satellites <i>can</i> operate under the conditions around Moon (it lacks Earth&#x27;s protective magnetic field!)), that a few dedicated and custom-made relay satellites would all that is needed to use (my opinion:) dirt-cheap run-of-the-mill Starlink satellites for a constellation around Moon.<p>Any thoughts on this?<p>[*] Maybe even a few of them as material is cheap but engineers are expensive. If you can build one thing, you can usually build a second&#x2F;third&#x2F;n-th of it for less per-unit costs than the previous (with diminishing savings between each).<p>[**] As stated in another post, I would rather expect the constellation to be in higher than in lower orbits so that fewer satellites would be needed to cover the same area on ground. This means that lunar mascons should not be of concern and even if they were, the satellites would still have ion thrusters to compensate for that.",general,general,

If we’re willing to do that — if we’re able to trade off “Fort Knox” security for Doritos — we can get dramatically higher speed and efficiency for those transactions, and the options we have for implementing this significantly widen. Those options also tend to be inherently safer than their on-chain counterparts, because they both operate on an abstract level, and don’t impact the majority of investment capital entrusted to the network, which tends to lie dormant unmoving in cold wallets regardless.<p>But if we’re only willing to put Doritos purchases on-chain for some reason because we stubbornly refuse to give up Fort Knox security, and demand a permanent record of our Doritos transactions until the heat death of the universe, we end up with a lot less decentralization, and our options for scaling narrow and become increasingly complex (e.g. sharding).<p>Worse still, Visa does 50,000+ tps — and that’s just one credit card company.

So they were not copyrighted and anyone was free to use, both then and today.<p>In the 1970s, IBM began to increasingly copyright add-on components, but left the core OS public domain. However, a lot of new features went into those copyrighted add-ons (MVS&#x2F;SE, MVS&#x2F;SP, ACF&#x2F;TCAM, ACF&#x2F;VTAM, TSO&#x2F;E, SPF, etc), so if you just stuck to the public domain core OS you were running something a lot more limited than what you got with all of IBM&#x27;s copyrighted add-ons.<p>Finally, starting in the early 1980s, IBM started copyrighting the core OS as well. The big change was the introduction of MVS&#x2F;XA in 1983 – MVS&#x2F;XA supported 31-bit addressing (as opposed to the 24-bit addressing of previous versions).

He doesn&#x27;t use typical politician tactics such as US v THEM, doesn&#x27;t use empathizing phrases.

In this case, I would prefer to clarify the point of your concern in a postscript instead of editing the original text, since that&#x27;s much better for the integrity of the discussion.<p>However, because omission of all mention of what&#x27;s desired to be understood, in this form of inquiry so particularly diminishes the likelihood of success for your (rhetorical, implied) inquiry, or else is a omission possibly due to inattention or haste, and I have observed almost identical responses to a increasing sample of comments other than to my own from where I have been able to discern additional semantic information about the question posed, and this has been a reliable negative indicator of sincerity and a consistent indicator of positive derogatory intent on the part of the non understanding declaration, I consequently do not wish to fall into a conversational trap set up only to insult or deride anything that I have said. Indeed, since you have stated that you don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m saying, and this can be taken to mean total incomprehension on your part, obviously simply rewriting my comment alone is not any guarantee of my being able to help you at all. Since this is something that I feel strongly about personally, I am entirely happy to completely structure my original comment anew and break it down into the constructive components and argumentative logic to convey my meaning with the maximum possible clarity.<p>in absolutely no way am I meaning to condescend to you or criticise your motivation or personal character in this response - absolutely the opposite : the difficulty this presents is that if eg English language comprehension is involved in a fundamental part of your reaction, then I will need to consider this and compose any renewed comment accordingly. For example this reply itself is complicated grammatically and I will restate myself in accordance with your response if any. The only reason why I write this way initially is because I want to convey the nuances of my predicament as clearly as possible to the audience in general and also for the consideration of the moderators if by any chance this is interpreted in a negative light that I haven&#x27;t been able to anticipate and prevent from affecting the most broad perception of my writing which is by virtue of being a public forum necessarily and preferably my primary concern. In different circumstances but in cases of apparently identical correspondence with the same comment on my language, when I failed to appreciate the pejorative intended meaning and absence of goodwill in the statement that I replied to, it happened that the negative overtones superimposed and obscured all beyond the cursory impression of a snarky exchange and it was thought that I was engaging with a troll deliberately in order to start a cryptic flame war in the guise of semantics. I wasn&#x27;t and I am not now attempting anything of the sort. But as is clear from my defensive language already, I&#x27;ve been caused to infer something potentially negative which effect I&#x27;m entirely certain could have been averted had you made your comment more understand, as well.<p>(I&#x27;ve worked on concurrent channel linguistic analysis since the early nineties following a successful project processing telephone sales transcripts for outcome prediction. English is far more wealthy and rich in structure than even linguists sometimes realise.

Yes and no. In theory, cryptocurrencies can really provide an effective and economical channel for money transfers to help alleviate poverty through remittances. However, there are two principle problems. Firstly, coins such as Bitcoin remain too volatile, in fact ten times more volatile than major currencies (Baur &amp; Dimpfl 2021). This means that if migrants were to use such channel they would be exposing themselves to extreme risks. But, more importantly users of bitcoin may find themselves victims of speculative attacks, as the cryptocurrencies’ value remains completely speculatively constructed. Secondly, as with international bank transfers, cryptocurrencies need a bank account to buy and sell it.

Unfortunately for CDC, they got the balance of the design wrong.

The court must try to give effect to what are here the two conflicting public interests. The weight to be attached to each will vary according to the circumstances. The significance of the evidence will differ as will the gravity of the breach of Article 8, according to the facts of the particular case. The decision will depend on all the circumstances. Here, the court cannot ignore the reality of the situation. This is not a case where the conduct of the defendant&#x27;s insurers is so outrageous that the defence should be struck out. The case, therefore, has to be tried. It would be artificial and undesirable for the actual evidence, which is relevant and admissible, not to be placed before the judge who has the task of trying the case. We accept Mr Owen&#x27;s submission that to exclude the use of the evidence would create a wholly undesirable situation. Fresh medical experts would have to be instructed on both sides. Evidence which is relevant would have to be concealed from them, perhaps resulting in a misdiagnosis; and it would not be possible to cross-examine the claimant appropriately. For these reasons we do not consider it would be right to interfere with the Judge&#x27;s decision not to exclude the evidence.<p>Mr Weir&#x27;s submission that we should determine the issue on the basis of the facts as they were before the district judge is not realistic. Nonetheless, it is right that we should make clear that we do not accept that the criticism of the claimant&#x27;s legal advisers for deciding not to reveal the contents of the video films in issue to their medical experts is justified. It was sensible to defer doing so until it was known whether the evidence could be used. While not excluding the evidence it is appropriate to make clear that the conduct of the insurers was improper and not justified. We disagree with the indication by Judge Harris to the contrary. The fact that the insurers may have been motivated by a desire to achieve what they considered would be a just result does not justify either the commission of trespass or the contravention of the claimant&#x27;s privacy which took place. We come to this conclusion irrespective of whether Mr Weir is right in contending that in this particular case the evidence could be obtained by other means.<p>Excluding the evidence is not, moreover, the only weapon in the court&#x27;s armoury. The court has other steps it can take to discourage conduct of the type of which complaint is made. In particular it can reflect its disapproval in the orders for costs which it makes. In this appeal, we therefore propose, because the conduct of the insurers gave rise to the litigation over admissibility of the evidence which has followed upon their conduct, to order the defendants to pay the costs of these proceedings to resolve this issue before the district judge, Judge Harris and this court even though we otherwise dismiss the appeal. This is subject to Mr Owen having an opportunity to persuade us to do otherwise. In addition, we would indicate to the trial judge that when he comes to deal with the question of costs he should take into account the defendant&#x27;s conduct which is the subject of this appeal when deciding the appropriate order for costs. He may consider the costs of the inquiry agent should not be recovered. If he concludes, as the complainant now contends, that there is an innocent explanation for what is shown as to the claimant&#x27;s control of her movements then this is a matter which should be reflected in costs, perhaps by ordering the defendants to pay the costs throughout on an indemnity basis. In giving effect to the overriding objective, and taking into account the wider interests of the administration of justice, the court must while doing justice between the parties, also deter improper conduct of a party while conducting litigation. We do not pretend that this is a perfect reconciliation of the conflicting public interests. It is not; but at least the solution does not ignore the insurer&#x27;s conduct.",general,general,

Bitcoin is a settlement layer and when evaluating  the speed of a settlement layer, the emphasis should be on speed of settlement assurances and transaction finality[1]. Bitcoin being an open decentralized settlement layer makes this even more important. Comparing bitcoin to visa or sepa which don&#x27;t settle instantly is disingenuous at best and ignorant at worst. If you want faster transactions, use a layer 2 solution like the lightening network which is orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than visa [2].<p>Bitcoin is ponzi scheme: This is a complete fallacy both in theory and in practice and it&#x27;s pretty offensive to suggest that well-meaning people working hard to make finance open and globally accessible are a cabal of scammers looking to steal money from unsuspecting investors.

A lot of these design choices make a lot more sense if you believe that complex Unix applications are supposed to be built from multiple loosely-coupled programs that perform exactly one task each, and communicate by piping data to one another.  I think the two design decisions discussed in this article only create problems for developers who write programs that do &quot;too much,&quot; such that the programs can no longer make best use of the OS facilities.<p>&gt; Unix signals<p>Unix signals are an asynchronous best-effort form of out-of-band IPC.  Because the programs that make up your Unix application <i>already use</i> pipes for IPC (which are synchronous and reliable), the role of the signal handler in a program would be to either absorb the signal by taking some localized action, or translate the signal into some piped IPC message to other program(s) in the application to consume and handle.<p>It&#x27;s been pointed out elsewhere that threads and signals don&#x27;t play nicely.  But that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for a multi-program Unix application -- you&#x27;d keep the multi-threaded logic in a separate program(s) from the signal-handling logic, and have the signal-handling program forward the multi-threaded program the signal data in-band, via a pipe.  For example, you might factor the application into a supervisor program and one or more subordinate programs (which can be multi-threaded), and have the supervisor intercept signals and route the relevant IPC notification to subordinates via pipes.<p>&gt; Unix permissions<p>The &quot;one user and one group&quot; model for files stops being so limiting if you can make it so the different programs that make up your application run as different users and groups.  For example, a &quot;logger&quot; program in your application would have a separate user&#x2F;group ID than a &quot;database&quot; program, and in doing so, ensure that the &quot;logger&quot; program can only access log state, and the &quot;database&quot; program can only access database state.",web/mobile,finance,

Interlaced media (funnily) requires a lot more bandwidth to transmit with modern codecs.  I say funnily because interlacing was a technique to save bandwidth for analog transmissions.

This manager trusts themself technically so reluctantly (actually not so reluctantly) they try to dictate solutions.<p>The common characteristic here is someone who perceives themselves to have high technical skill but very shaky skills with management and hiring.

Let&#x27;s take an example: Autowiring. Java is the type of language heavily that pushes programmers to use the Strategy Design Pattern. It&#x27;s almost the core of the language&#x27;s philosophy. However, if I want a file that globally states to always use a specific Strategy then I have to turn away from native Java to the dark magic of dependency injection frameworks (Guice, Spring). If I&#x27;m reading such code, I have to know to look for a file that maps a Bean to a specific strategy; which is not apparent anywhere on either file. It&#x27;s somewhere else in XML or a vague annotation that I have to now wrap my head around. To do so, I have to understand arbitrary limitations to the dark magic like whether this Bean is matched by name, type, or qualifier. All of this can be a little overwhelming at times when you&#x27;re looking at a file where every variable is a Bean.

The manager will then start looking for those 10am, 4pm updates instead of to you, as you provide them like clockwork and they’re well done and detailed.<p>I promise this works.

Another gap is that only GLSL (Vulkan flavor) has support for explicit memory semantics. Of course, WGSL currently has none of this, as it&#x27;s something of a lowest common denominator.<p>In the game world, it is very common to write shaders in HLSL  because of good support on Windows, and then use the tools mentioned above to translate into other shader languages.

This failure stems both from assumptions embedded in the Chicago School framework and from the way this framework assesses competition.<p>&gt; Notably, the present approach fails even if one believes that antitrust should promote only consumer interests. Critically, consumer interests include not only cost but also product quality, variety, and innovation. Protecting these long-term interests requires a much thicker conception of “consumer welfare” than what guides the current approach. But more importantly, the undue focus on consumer welfare is misguided. It betrays legislative history, which reveals that Congress passed antitrust laws to promote a host of political economic ends—including our interests as workers, producers, entrepreneurs, and citizens. It also mistakenly supplants a concern about process and structure (i.e., whether power is sufficiently distributed to keep markets competitive) with a calculation regarding outcome (i.e., whether consumers are materially better off).<p>&gt; Antitrust law and competition policy should promote not welfare but competitive markets.

Something about the design space PMod is trying to solve (off-board peripheral modules connected to a main board through a standard connector) is inherently hostile to high-frequency applications, and no specification is capable of getting around this limitation.<p>3. PMod is actually capable of high-frequency applications, although most PMod ports are not particularly designed for this.<p>Your original message seemed to be claiming (1), but none of your subsequent arguments have offered any support for (1) that I can see.

And I agree with the author in that it&#x27;s related to independent-mindedness. I can reflect on memories growing up where other young men were much more &quot;in tune&quot; to the group. They more intuitively understood the social cost of adopting an unpopular position. Or they just had the sensitivity to know that a position or statement wouldn&#x27;t be well-received within the group. Or they just valued social harmony in general more than accurately representing what they believed to be true.<p>That&#x27;s a bit different than when I think of young men in general being more confident than they ought to be. It has more to do with the goal: status within a group vs putting effort into finding what you believe is true and accurately representing that truth potentially at a social cost.,general,finance,

423,2021-05-18,"This, although to clarify you&#x27;re still going to have to sell into some of your marketing channels (such as when partnering with a climbing gym as suggested above).<p>I&#x27;m a programmer turned business man and I have autism spectrum disorder so learning to sell was difficult, but doable. Now I&#x27;m a natural. I had this conversation with another founder last week. She&#x27;d sold nothing so far.<p>Here&#x27;s the crux. Selling is a deeply personal experience. You&#x27;re getting someone else to open their wallet and give you their money. Even if that&#x27;s not exactly what the transaction is it&#x27;s how it feels. Trust makes a massive difference here. Some people engender trust because of their natural trustworthy disposition. The rest of us are not naturally so likable and do not have a likely future as a con artist. Take time to understand your customers. If you don&#x27;t know how to sell a relationship with a channel partner then you need to not be talking you need to be asking questions, getting to know them. How does their business operate, what do they need and want, then its your job to find synergy.<p>Selling is most effective when you&#x27;re finding someone a solution to their problem, not when you&#x27;re persuading them to change their behavior for your benefit (that&#x27;s the slimy shit we all hate).<p>Let&#x27;s take the climbing gym example. Let&#x27;s imagine they have a problem with churn, or competition from other climbing gyms. You have a product climbers will like. Can the climbing gym give your product as a gift to members who sign up for a plan? See how you are both aligned there? It&#x27;s just one example and perhaps not the right one but you get the idea.<p>Also, if you want to play the social game I find lots of products that drive most of their revenue from social content marketing (Insta, TikTok, etc...). If you want to play that game it can work. I don&#x27;t know that area well so I can&#x27;t give you tips. I just see lots of slick content from small brands and occasionally I buy a product from them.<p>Selling is completely transformed when you *know* your product is good for them they just don&#x27;t know it yet. As opposed to that awful feeling of begging for approval.<p>Lastly, ALWAYS ASK FOR THE SALE. You want to ask, and get the rejection or the sale.

571,2021-05-19,"They were originally a segregation tool, which is a bad way to start. It was not uncommon for the government to use imminent domain to evict huge groups of black people to build white-only public housing. That continued up until the early 60s.<p>The American style of public housing is also often large developments with many occupants. As the occupants basically have to be poor to qualify, the concentration of poverty tends to lead to a lot of negative externalities. &quot;The projects&quot; are often notorious for gangs, drugs and crime. My impression is that much of Europe does more interspersed public housing, similar to Section 8 (subsidized rent to a private landlord) except the government owns the homes. The US attempted to make some strides by redeveloping former &quot;projects&quot; into mixed-income developments, but there is no requirement that the new development have at least as many low-income units as the demolished building. As a result, only about 12% of people relocated from those buildings eventually move back into the new building.<p>Funding has also been a big issue. The housing developments become delapidated because we don&#x27;t fund them enough to maintain them. That above mentioned redevelopment project was aimed at fixing the most distressed housing projects; sadly the public housing that was targeted was that which would bring the most money to the city, rather than the most damaged housing. Some have levied criticisms that public housing has been intentionally underfunded so that it seems like a debacle to build support for Section 8, which allows private companies to profit from housing the poor.<p>Also as a result of the lack of funding, public housing is often hard to get. The median time on a waiting list for public housing is 9 months. 25% of people spent at least a year and a half on the wait list. Housing Choice Vouchers (I think that&#x27;s Section 8) is even worse; the median time on waiting lists is 1.5 years, and 25% of applicants spent at least 3 years on the waiting list. Over 50% of HCV waiting lists are currently closed to new applicants because they&#x27;re so backlogged. This is often a compounding issue for people with mental health issues or drug addiction. If you are removed from your unit for any reason, you go to the back of the wait-list. I know a social worker who will fight tooth and nail to get someone with a debilitating mental illness housing, only to have them get evicted the next month as a result of their mental illness.<p>Lastly, because we build these giant complexes, it&#x27;s trivial to tell whether an address is an a public housing project. They&#x27;re not well regarded publicly because of aforementioned negative externalities, so anything that requires an address requires you to basically announce that you live in public housing. That invites a lot of discrimination, especially with job applications and finding housing once you&#x27;re on your feet enough to try to move out. &quot;Im currently or was recently too poor to afford rent&quot; isn&#x27;t something that most landlords or employers look kindly on, especially since many in the US consider poverty to be a character flaw.<p>So historically, US public housing has been racist, in poor shape, hard to get and generally unfavorably viewed by the populace causing discrimination. They&#x27;re often referred to as &quot;housing of last resort&quot; because they&#x27;re so undesirable that people won&#x27;t live there unless they have no other choice.

597,2021-05-19,"Hello!<p>I work at a startup and have been working on a cool project NodeJS based project. Even though, it is a WordPress position, when I&#x27;m free, I take my time to work on interesting projects. Given what we&#x27;re trying to achieve in this soon-to-be proprietary system, I noticed optimization issues with it. I tried bombarding the endpoints with 200 requests at a time and pm2 monit showed a few issues.<p>Before I talk about the pm2 stats, I would like to talk about what the system actually does. We sent a domain name to our endpoint, for example, say, dev.to. The endpoint makes an entry to database and it emits an event to analyze that website. The endpoint quickly does what it is supposed and sends back a 200 response but the process afterwards takes a lot of time as it involves HTTP requests a huge sets of things it needs to analysis the website for, a long with Puppeteer, potentially a lot of loops with hundreds, if not thousands of iterations.<p>What I talked about above, resulted in at almost 100% of CPU usage in PM2 stats, the heap was almost 100% too, EventEmitter gave us memory leaks warnings. Given that there is no queue or in-memory DS like Redis, I think the event loop was overwhelmed with 200 requests at the same time which involves a lot of processing! I&#x27;m not happy with the results and will present issues further down the road.<p>NOTE: Keep in mind that the slow process I am talking about takes place on an app level. The ExpressJS route only emits and event to start the process for that specific domain that it just saved into the database. I did this because there was no need to keep a user waiting for 10 seconds!<p>I discussed this with my boss and he encouraged me to take time and ask for help around the community. This is why I am here! Have you worked on such a project? If so, how did you handle it? What would you recommend me to do in this case? Should I go for cronjobs instead of event based system?

An order directing payment of all or a fair portion of a prisoner&#x27;s daily subsistence costs may survive against the estate of the prisoner.<p>And Florida does not pay prisoners a minimum wage.

Should prisoners be allowed to decide when they turn lights on and off in their cells to save power? Prisoners have no say in how much their accommodations cost.

Our 1:1s are <i>their</i> time to talk about whatever <i>they</i> want to talk about. It&#x27;s not my time to pontificate. But if they don&#x27;t have anything to talk about, I&#x27;ll ask them questions! Things like: where do you see yourself in 5 years? Are you happy with the project you&#x27;re working on? Are there cool projects that you want to work on? Is there a piece of technology that you haven&#x27;t used that you would like to learn?<p>And then once I get those answers, I work with them to achieve those goals.

If they want to work on Project X, then I figure out a way for them to transition off what they&#x27;re doing now and move on to the other thing.<p>I also spend a lot of time getting to know them as people. I know their partner&#x27;s and kids&#x27; names, their hobbies, where they go on vacation.

Why shouldn&#x27;t I apply there?&quot; and I just shrugged and said, &quot;You should. You should always have an idea of what you&#x27;re worth on the market, and if you think that&#x27;s a better fit for you than here, I support you.&quot; And he applied and he got an offer and it was a little more than he was making here, but he declined because he felt like he&#x27;d be a cog in the machine at Stripe versus a valued member of my team.

5362,2021-05-24,"&gt; I assume after some time you start to assemble a fairly high dimensional model of reality on these various topics. During this journey, has it ever caught your attention that the articles you read assert that reality is(!) a certain way, but due to your greater depth of knowledge, you know that the article is not actually true?<p>To be honest, I think there&#x27;s still quite a long way to go before I can reach this point. I&#x27;ve only started this process a few months ago, and it takes many, many hours to discuss all the ins and outs of every subject. I wish I could spend my days doing this, but unfortunately I also have social obligations such as work and studies :-). Perhaps in a few years from now I&#x27;ll be able to truly feel this for a variety of subjects, but that&#x27;s far from being the case right now and the only articles which might make me experience this feeling generally are articles from mainstream media talking about stuff I&#x27;ve known in detail for a long period of time (most particularly video games and computer science); in these particular cases, the Gell-Mann amnesia effect is definitely real. Now, when there is a topic I know absolutely nothing about, I&#x27;ll still read many news articles and assume that all of them are true to begin with, just so that I can compare data and opinions. Only then will I try to read more specialized works, such as books, in order to see to what extent what I&#x27;ve found corresponds to what whizzes have to say on this subject. Talking about newspaper articles, I also try to read fewer &quot;breaking news&quot; articles, but rather try to take a more distant approach which consists in reading articles several months after events occurred in order to get a clearer view of what has happened and the impact of the event in question. The main drawback is that I&#x27;m not necessarily fully aware of what&#x27;s going on in the world 24&#x2F;7, but at least I find it generates way less anxiety and enables to take a step back on what&#x27;s happening.<p>&gt; My intuition is that you&#x27;d want to be very restrictive with who gets on (and stays on), and you&#x27;d need to have multiple levels of permissions. For people to ascend to higher levels, they would (among other things) first be required to develop the ability to think in certain ways. I find this idea very appealing, because poor thinking skills are a fundamental root cause of everything....so, having a system where quality (near perfect) thinking is not just a goal, but is mandatory....this would be something the world has never seen before.<p>Absolutely agreed! You perfectly summarized what I had in mind.<p>Everything else that you said is very interesting; by the bye, it is the very first time I have such an in-depth discussion with someone on HN and it&#x27;s really great to see where it can lead and all the ideas it may generate.

Filtering down to reports with clear sourcing back to actual academic or industry research, the confusion pretty much goes away. This is an issue where the actual facts have been oversimplified and dumbed down and wrong interpretations have caught on and been repeated by people with no understanding of the underlying mechanisms for data loss and for forestalling the data loss.<p>In particular, there are <i>tons</i> of people on forums like &#x2F;r&#x2F;hardware who think that plugging in the SSD will prevent charge from leaking out of a floating gate memory cell or the charge trap memory cells now used by almost all SSDs. It won&#x27;t. <i>Using</i> the SSD can lead to data being re-written before it has degraded unrecoverably, through several possible mechanisms. But aside from drives like the Samsung 840 and 840 EVO that were retrofitted with explicit data degradation checks as part of their firmware&#x27;s operation, merely leaving the drive plugged in will not help directly, and the temperature effects compared to leaving it on a shelf will be a slight detriment to data retention.<p>It&#x27;s helpful to recall that the JEDEC standards for SSD write endurance require consumer drives to provide 1 year of unpowered data retention for a drive that has reached the end of its write endurance. For brand-new flash, the leakage is orders of magnitude slower than for worn-out flash, so it&#x27;s quite reasonable to expect data retention comparable to some of the storage mediums that actually make economic sense for archival.",AI/Data Science,general,

But if the company overall has attrition and my team doesn&#x27;t, I must be doing something right, right? Not necessarily... again, could be sheer dumb luck that I have people that hate looking for jobs or something.<p>(Disclaimer: I have fired people, and I have had two people transferred off my team onto other teams, and both of them have left the company, but I don&#x27;t count those as attrition under <i>me</i>.)<p>But if I had to pick something as a thing that I do to make sure my teams are happy and want to stay, it&#x27;s this: I care deeply about the people who work for me. I&#x27;m a people-first leader. I firmly and strongly believe that unhappy people do shitty work, and happy people do good work. I believe that you don&#x27;t get what you don&#x27;t ask for (eg, raises, promotions, cool projects), and I also believe that most people won&#x27;t ask for those things... so I pro-actively ask for them. Our 1:1s are <i>their</i> time to talk about whatever <i>they</i> want to talk about. It&#x27;s not my time to pontificate. But if they don&#x27;t have anything to talk about, I&#x27;ll ask them questions! Things like: where do you see yourself in 5 years? Are you happy with the project you&#x27;re working on? Are there cool projects that you want to work on? Is there a piece of technology that you haven&#x27;t used that you would like to learn?<p>And then once I get those answers, I work with them to achieve those goals. If they want to be a manager in 5 years, then we work on that. If they love the project they&#x27;re on, then I get them more involved. If they want to work on Project X, then I figure out a way for them to transition off what they&#x27;re doing now and move on to the other thing.<p>I also spend a lot of time getting to know them as people. I know their partner&#x27;s and kids&#x27; names, their hobbies, where they go on vacation. I frequently ask questions about those, like, &quot;Did [partner&#x27;s name] get that promotion?&quot; or &quot;Are you looking forward to your next trip to Disney World?&quot; or &quot;Has [kid&#x27;s name] seen the movie The Mitchells &amp; The Machines?&quot; and so on.<p>I&#x27;m transparent and honest. I make it clear that I support them as much as I possibly can, and that I would rather they be successful and happy than successful and miserable. One of my guys came to me about three months ago and said, &quot;A recruiter from Stripe reached out to me about a role there. Why shouldn&#x27;t I apply there?&quot; and I just shrugged and said, &quot;You should. You should always have an idea of what you&#x27;re worth on the market, and if you think that&#x27;s a better fit for you than here, I support you.&quot; And he applied and he got an offer and it was a little more than he was making here, but he declined because he felt like he&#x27;d be a cog in the machine at Stripe versus a valued member of my team. On the flip side, the offer clarified some ideas that he had in his mind about where he wanted to take his career, and so for the past few months we&#x27;ve been talking in our 1:1s about how to shift his career into a different direction, and he&#x27;s been taking advantage of some opportunities that have come up.<p>(NOTE: Despite the above scenario, I would never ever suggest to your boss that you are looking elsewhere, no matter how good your relationship is with your boss.

5608,2021-05-24,"&gt; Maybe this sentiment is a holdover from an earlier era<p>It&#x27;s a holdover from two different earlier eras.<p>First, you have everything up to about 1998, which covers MacOS Classic through Mac OS 8, and Windows up through Win98. At the beginning of this period, when &quot;PC&quot; meant MS-DOS, the usability different was obviously stark. But even in GUI era of PCs, System 7 compared favorably with Windows 3.1, and Mac OS 8 compared favorably with Windows 95.<p>Then Windows 98 and Mac OS 9 came out, and I&#x27;d say that things at least evened up. All else being equal, OS 9&#x27;s GUI was still simpler and more intuitive, to my taste, but all else was not equal. Windows 9x had memory protection and pre-emptive multitasking, and Mac OS Classic didn&#x27;t, and there were issues with system extensions and stability in Mac OS that I personally felt were more troublesome than Windows&#x27;s famous BSOD problem during that era. This opinion could be a product of my experience working tech support at the time. BSOD was usually fixed by cursing profusely while rebooting. System extension conflicts were fixed at great physical and emotional cost to the person doing the fixing.<p>So I&#x27;d say Windows was generally easier to use than Macs for a while, until OS X eventually came into its own. It&#x27;s harder to place a start time on this, but let&#x27;s say 2002ish, with the release of Jaguar. And then there&#x27;s been a sort of long slow decline as they clutter up the GUI, while at the same time Microsoft was putting serious work into cleaning things up. I&#x27;m not sure if the switch happened during the Windows 7 era or the Windows 10 era, but yeah, I&#x27;d definitely say I find Windows easier to use nowadays.<p>Personally, the main thing keeping me on Macs nowadays is frankly just the touchpad, to which I seem to be addicted.",devops/OS,devops/OS,

After all, how much tax to collect is a structural and public spending issue, and a ideological issue.

First, it might seem that such an optimization would not be that useful, but actually it&#x27;s one of the most critical ones - we want to write the persistent data structure code in a language idiomatic way yet know that performance sensitive JavaScript code will be generated.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem.<p>In Clojure `and` and `or` are just macros that expand to `let` + `if`, simple and elegant:<p><pre><code>    (defmacro and
      ([] true)
      ([x] x)
      ([x &amp; next]
       `(let [and# ~x]
          (if and# (and ~@next) and#))))
</code></pre>
... except when you target JavaScript - which is not an expression oriented language. So `let` will be wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). Google Closure does elide these when it can, but it will give up after only a few levels of nesting. For an IIFE to appear in the middle of a conditional is a performance killer.<p>Another complication is that it&#x27;s not safe to just use `&amp;&amp;` and `||` blindly because of `0` and the empty string and the other cases which are not false-y in Clojure(Script). Checks for JavaScript false-y values are a performance killer.<p>So years ago we implemented a simple form of type inference which annotates the AST with type information as a compiler pass on every node when possible. As long we know the JavaScript `if` will receive a boolean value we can elide the JS false-y value check.<p>But this is also exactly the information we need to safely run a following pass that looks for the above and&#x2F;or syntactical patterns and optimize it. As long as each nested `if` is guaranteed to return a boolean, we can remove the local and use `&amp;&amp;` or `||` instead.<p>The and&#x2F;or optimization pass ended up being ~120 lines of code with no actual dependencies on anything else in the ClojureScript analyzer or compiler because the ClojureScript AST is just plain EDN - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;clojure&#x2F;clojurescript&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;main&#x2F;cljs&#x2F;cljs&#x2F;analyzer&#x2F;passes&#x2F;and_or.cljc"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;clojure&#x2F;clojurescript&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;mai...</a><p>Happy to answer any further questions about this!<p>UPDATE: Also ClojureScript turned 10 years old this month :)",web/mobile,finance,

If you have to dig into the details of a function to understand what it does, you have failed to sufficiently explain what the function does through its naming and set of arguments.</i><p>That&#x27;s fine in theory and I still sort-of believe that, but in practice, I came to believe most programming languages are insufficiently expressive for this vision to be true.<p>Take, as a random example, this bit of C++:<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;&#x2F;...
  const auto foo = Frobnicate(bar, Quuxify);
</code></pre>
Ok, I know what Frobnification is. I know what Quuxify does, it&#x27;s defined a few lines above. From that single line, I can guess it Frobs every member of bar via Quuxify. But is bar modified? Gotta check the signature of Frobnicate! That means either getting an IDE help popup, or finding the declaration.<p><pre><code>  template&lt;typename Stuffs, typename Fn&gt;
  auto Frobnicate(const std::vector&lt;Stuffs&gt;&amp;, Fn)
    -&gt; std::vector&lt;Stuffs&gt;;
</code></pre>
From the signature, I can see that bar full of Bars isn&#x27;t going to be modified. But then I think, is foo.size() going to be equal to bar.size()? What if bar is empty? Can Frobnicate throw an exception? Are there any special constraints on the function Fn passed to it? Does Fn have to be a funcallable thing? Can&#x27;t tell that until I pop into <i>definition</i> of Frobnicate.<p>I&#x27;ll omit the definition here. But now that I see it, I realize that Fn has to be a function of a very particular signature, that Fn is applied to every other element of the input vector (and not all of them, as I assumed), that the code has a bug and will crash if the input vector has less than 2 elements, and it calls three other functions that may or may not have their own restrictions on arguments, and may or may not throw an exception.<p>If I don&#x27;t have a fully-configured IDE, I&#x27;ll likely just ignore it and bear the risk. If I have, I&#x27;ll routinely jump-to-definition into all these functions, quickly eye them for any potential issues... and, if I have the time, I&#x27;ll put a comment on top of Frobnicate declaration, documenting everything I just learned - because holy hell, I don&#x27;t want to waste my time doing the same thing next week. I would rename the function itself to include extra details, but then the name would be 100+ characters long...<p>Some languages are better at this than others, but my point is, until we have programming languages that can (and force you to) express the entire function contract in its signature <i>and</i> enforce this at compile-time, it&#x27;s unsafe to assume a given function does what you think it does.

It really depends on the size of the lexicon in the language considered: if all you have is 50 rules in your type theory, do you really need to give each of them a name fully describing its semantics? Of course you don&#x27;t, so calling them inl1, sub2 etc. shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, if the name can still act as a reminder of the rule meaning.

The problem is that public transportation in the US at its best (NYC, Boston) is still a far-cry from actually &#x27;good&#x27; public transportation systems. In many places kids as young as 11 are able to independently navigate the city without the parents help when public transportation is well built. If anything, car dependence means that kids take 5 more years (16) before they can be independant and parents will often struggle to meet diverging needs of 3 children when the car is a single bottleneck.<p>Not-just-bikes does a great contrast between North America and the Netherlands to highlight how car-dependence can lead to struggles as a parent: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ul_xzyCDT98"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ul_xzyCDT98</a><p>Also, given that most upper middle class families usually have 3 cars (2 for parents work and 1 for a 16-yr old child), if public transport allows you to go from 3 -&gt; 1, that&#x27;s already a huge plus.

It is by no means a part of American culture. Most pre-ww2 cities such as the ones in the NE had perfectly acceptable public transportation for the time, which has since not been maintained as well. Even smaller cities such as Portsmouth NH and Portland ME are incredibly walkable, dense and public transport friendly. (rural culture is an entirely different point.

What the map does is get the key `v` from each map in the collection and we end up with a sequence that looks like `(&quot;hi&quot; &quot;there&quot; nil)` Since the last map in the collection `items` does not have a key `v` the value will return nil. We would then need to use the remove function with the nil? predicate which will remove all items in the collection that are nil. If we use keep, though, we could do this in one pass.<p><pre><code>  (def items [{:v &quot;hi&quot;} {:v &quot;there&quot;} {:m &quot;not v&quot;}])

For example, if studies show that IQ can be associated at least at some level with gene expression (the reality is it&#x27;s a complex mix of both biological lottery and social nurturing) then perhaps question the validity of applying IQ tests as gating functions in areas where they may be miss applied.

Kill all the innocent colonists to get rid of the warlord?<p>Even if it was the person that owns the rockets, if they&#x27;re on mars, they may no longer care about the earth assets. I mean, if its a one way trip, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything with them other than send supplies. I assume if they were to play warlord, its at a point where they no longer care about the supplies. If earth used those rockets to invade mars, mars would still have plenty of time to come up with a plan to shoot them down or whatever.<p>&gt; Needless to say, the likely-Earth-based shareholders are likely to be unimpressed by such a colonial government.<p>If mars is a one-way trip away, why would they care about Earth-based shareholders?<p>Not saying such a takeover would end well for mars, just that the isolation leaves it wide open for some maniac to play warlord. I also think its more likely that its not the person who owns the rockets, if someone does decide to do that.",general,general,

Or, in other words, burden of proof ;)<p>I hear so many invoke the concept of &quot;burden of proof&quot;, without appearing to have ever really reflected on the complex philosophical questions involved – which of many distinct principles for assigning the burden of proof ought we accept? Many of them sound plausible on the surface, yet can produce opposite results when applied to particular cases. And why and how are we obliged to accept any such principle? If there are multiple competing proposals as to the nature and contents of the &quot;burden of proof&quot;, how do we determine which (if any) of those proposals is right? Is there a single burden of proof across all of human thought, or does each discipline or field of endeavour adopt a burden of proof suited for its own needs? Do we force criminal law, high energy physics, mathematics, ancient history, psychiatry and philosophy to all share the same principles for determining the burden of proof? Or do we accept that each discipline needs to determine its own burden of proof according to its own distinct needs?<p>Such people would be well-served by familiarising themselves with some of the philosophical literature on the topic, for example James Cargile&#x27;s 1997 article &quot;On the Burden of Proof&quot; [0]. I think it is well summarised by his concluding paragraph:<p>&gt; Is there one, ultimately correct standard of proof? I don&#x27;t think so; but in a given case, it may be true that an appropriate standard of proof has been satisfied. It can be truly observed that a different standard has not been satisfied. Confusion can arise as to the significance of this fact.<p>And to quote the epistemologist Keith Lehrer&#x27;s (often-cited, including by Cargile&#x27;s paper I referenced above) 1971 address to Vassar College [1]:<p>&gt; ...generally arguments about where the burden of proof lies are unproductive. It is more reasonable to suppose that such questions are best left to courts of law where they have suitable application. In philosophy a different principle of agnoiology is appropriate, to wit, that no hypothesis should be rejected as unjustified without argument against it. Consequently, if the sceptic puts forth a hypothesis inconsistent with the hypothesis of common sense, then there is no burden of proof on either side...<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;3751305"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;3751305</a><p>[1] Keith Lehrer, Why Not Scepticism?, Philosophical Forum 2 (3):283 (1971)",general,finance,

Most places in the world, if you are using an extra kWh of power, the system needs to generate up to an extra marginal kWh from coal or gas.<p>You might be right if you are only using your power when it is cheapest (which usually implies the usage of base load nuclear), although it is surprisingly difficult to actually figure out whether you have generated no extra carbon.<p>Example 1: France generates power 70% from nuclear. However if a French person uses an extra kWh during base load, that could easily lead to one less kWh exported, which would most likely mean one extra kWh is generated from say coal somewhere else in Europe.<p>Example 2: New Zealand generates 60% of power from hydro.

I aim to flatten the learning curve of design tools, so everyone feels comfortable visualizing ideas.<p>I&#x27;ve worked as a designer in Silicon Valley for a decade at large tech companies and startups—most notably as Flexport&#x27;s first designer.

As the pandemic hit and the world locked down, I had a lot of time to think about the issues I&#x27;ve encountered as a designer. During this time, I helped 50+ startups by reviewing their UX and providing advice. I learned a lot about how these early-staged companies approached design and what I could build to help them.<p>Ultimately, my goal is to help teams create, collaborate, and communicate visually on digital experiences.

7040,2021-05-28,"Yes! T-Mobile is aiming to have 7-8M home broadband customers in 2025. Their home broadband business is relatively small right now, but it should be expanding fast. To put that in perspective, Verizon Fios only serves around 5M customers.  Getting 7-8M customers would probably make T-Mobile the 4th largest home broadband provider behind Comcast, Charter, and AT&amp;T.<p>Verizon has also announced that it&#x27;s looking to cover 50M households with home broadband in 2024.

Story of the day: Cheese photo leads to Liverpool drug dealer’s downfall
“In an awe-inspiring display of the power of the internet, police in Liverpool have arrested a drug dealer in connection with an online cheese sale. A 28-year-old man has been charged with controlled drug supply after a photo of him holding a block of cheese was posted on Reddit yesterday. The photo was posted by the user ‘Whatyouknowaboutdis?’ underneath a thread about the best place to buy cheese. The photo, captioned: “Cheese is good”, clearly shows the man holding a large block of cheese, however, one observant user noticed something very sinister. The cheese, which was only on top of a carrier bag, didn’t have a price label and appeared to be slightly curved towards the bottom. After seeking advice from other users, ‘Whatyouknowaboutdis?’ commented: “This is actually really interesting, the cheese is curved towards the bottom (in the pic) but if you look at the bag it’s flat. It’s on a bag, so the cheese is obviously curved due to the weight of the block. This is a new one to me, I can’t wait to hear the excuse.” As expected, the photo shot to the front page of Reddit, with more than 800 comments and counting, including several from users who claimed they were police officers and would be investigating. One user, who claimed to be a police officer with the Kings Cross Police Force in Australia, commented: “I’m a cop and I’m here to tell you … this is a very clear case of controlled drug supply. The cheese has clearly been purchased by this man.” The Reddit users were not to be disappointed, however, as the Liverpool police tweeted this morning: “We’ve arrested a man today. He was charged with drug offences after an image of him holding a piece of cheese was posted on @reddit.”

E.g., there&#x27;s no reason an app can&#x27;t simply compile multiple use cases into a single binary to get past review (in fact, this happens all the time). And, it&#x27;s <i>way</i> too broad to be about blocking access to private APIs, e.g., they&#x27;re blocking all running of Ruby, Python, Node, etc... with this rule.<p>I think the more specific match to what Apple is blocking with these rules is anything that resembles an App Store-like experience. Apple doesn&#x27;t want anything that can download and run arbitrary apps, because that would dilute their platform control and other advantages. There&#x27;s an excellent piece about why Apple is so afraid of this (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stratechery.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stratechery.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustain...</a>).<p>This motivation provides a more specific match to preventing arbitrary code execution: An App Store-like experience is almost impossible without downloading and executing code. It also matches the exception that Apple provides for &quot;educational apps designed to teach, develop, or allow students to test executable code may, in limited circumstances, download code provided that such code is not used for other purposes&quot; (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;app-store&#x2F;review&#x2F;guidelines&#x2F;#2.5.2"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;app-store&#x2F;review&#x2F;guidelines&#x2F;#2.5...</a>).<p>Furthermore, this perspective is support by other policies as well:<p>1. This is why Apple doesn&#x27;t allow third-party web rendering engines on the App Store. A third-party web engine could also be used to create an App Store-like experience.<p>2. See 4.2.7 (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;app-store&#x2F;review&#x2F;guidelines&#x2F;#4.2.7"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;app-store&#x2F;review&#x2F;guidelines&#x2F;#4.2...</a>), the rules around what remote desktop apps can do. These restrictions seem specifically written to prevent remote desktop features from being used to create an App Store-like experience.<p>So, while I think rule 2.4.2 does help with the goals you listed, if it were just about those goals, these rules would be written differently (e.g., allowing downloading and executing scripting languages). And I think there&#x27;s more evidence that rule 2.4.2 is more about preventing third-parties from providing App Store-like experiences.",web/mobile,general,

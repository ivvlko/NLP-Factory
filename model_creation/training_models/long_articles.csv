15,2021-05-17,"&gt; What if you don&#x27;t have an event loop though?<p>You can use my second-favorite technique: dedicate a thread to signals. Block the signals of interest, causing them to be queued. Do this early in main(), before spawning any threads, so that they&#x27;ll inherit the block. Spawn a thread which dequeues in a loop via sigwaitinfo or sigtimedwait. Signal handling without a signal handler!<p>&gt; Roughly? What are the differences [between the self-pipe trick and signalfd]? The most obvious to me is the fact I can read siginfo structures from the file descriptor.<p>That&#x27;s the difference I mean. If you want to get those from the self-pipe trick, you need to do it yourself, dealing with the platform difference crap this article describes. Additionally, if you write more than one byte per signal, you&#x27;ll have to be careful of half-written messages, since your signal handler can&#x27;t block for capacity. (Why? It may be blocking the thread that does the reading, so it&#x27;d deadlock.) Maybe you&#x27;d have a separate buffer for the leftover part that doesn&#x27;t quite fit, or ensure your your message size divides evenly into the pipe buffer capacity (see F_GETPIPE_SZ), or drop messages if there&#x27;s insufficient capacity (use FIONREAD; the capacity shouldn&#x27;t go down unless you&#x27;re using the same pipe for multiple signals and don&#x27;t have them masking each other out). Stuff like this can get complex but the basic technique of just ensuring ctrl-C reaches your event loop isn&#x27;t that bad. You have to be very careful in the signal handler, but it&#x27;s like five lines long, so life goes on.<p>Another difference is that installing a self-pipe handler lets you see the previous handler (if any). I&#x27;ve heard of chaining handlers to address complaints like kstenerud&#x27;s about libraries. I&#x27;ve never actually wanted to share signals like that, but it&#x27;s something one could try.

Data debt is a type of technical debt that is created when teams don’t catalogue, clean and categorize or organize their data. It drags down productivity and costs the organization in compute costs. This costs teams time and effort, but too many times, data debt is difficult to measure. There are two primary drivers that drive the cost of data debt and lead to understanding your need for a data discovery tool:<p>Discovery time: Data discovery time is the amount of time that it takes for your data engineering and analytics team to find the right data, understand what it means and use it to analyze the data request.<p>Organization time: This is the amount of time spent cleaning, documenting and organizing data to make it legible for other employees<p>You can measure the financial impact of data debt by looking at how much money it costs your team to discover and organize the data. We recommend calculating data debt as the hours spent discovering + organizing data * average cost per hour.<p>By having an idea of the cost of data debt, teams can more easily calculate their return on investment for a data discovery tool. Without the existing baseline, it’s much more difficult to get buy-in from the managers controlling the budget for your team. We hope this helps.",AI/Data Science,general,AI/Data Science

So while I disagree with the overall premise (more on that below), giving prisoners a real wage for their work would still be an improvement over the current system, which is the worst of both worlds.<p>----<p>But ignoring that and just talking about the policy on its own merits, I would ask the same question about whether those room and board costs are fair. I can choose where I live, a prisoner can&#x27;t. Prison accommodations are not a free market.<p>So should prisoners be allowed to &quot;shop around&quot; for which prison they want to be incarcerated in based on the prices of room and board? Should prisoners be allowed to decide when they turn lights on and off in their cells to save power? Prisoners have no say in how much their accommodations cost. In multiple states they don&#x27;t even have voting rights, so they lack the bare minimum of input into the policy behind how those costs are determined.<p>To me, it&#x27;s a little problematic to charge someone for something that they are legally forced to purchase. We should generally try to avoid that. But it&#x27;s <i>extra</i> problematic to force someone to work to pay for that charge. That&#x27;s when we start getting into direct comparisons with slavery. Slaves were also provided living accomodations on plantations. But like prisoners, they couldn&#x27;t leave or execute any choices about their arrangement.<p>In practice, what really is the difference between charging a prisoner for tampons and charging them for the electricity in their cell block?<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brennancenter.org&#x2F;our-work&#x2F;research-reports&#x2F;charging-inmates-stay-prison-smart-policy"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brennancenter.org&#x2F;our-work&#x2F;research-reports&#x2F;char...</a>",general,general,general

If you&#x27;re sufficiently distributed, using already-existing hardware, with spare compute on extremely efficient devices, it could conceivably cost less.  Even if a centralized server farm would be doing an order of magnitude less math, smaller processors use an order of magnitude less power to do that math.<p>Bitcoin proper has a central ledger- every miner needs to hear about your transaction to verify it.  Lightning is a clumsy way of reducing how many actors need to be notified of your transaction.  Better currencies include stuff like that as first class.

Some &quot;Plant fat sources&quot; have a fatty acid content consisting mostly of oleic acid (mono-unsaturated), e.g. olive oil, cashew nuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pistachio<p>3. Some &quot;Plant fat sources&quot; have a fatty acid content consisting mostly of linoleic acid (poly-unsaturated), e.g. sunflower oil and most other cheap vegetable oils, many seeds<p>4. A few &quot;Plant fat sources&quot; have a fatty acid content consisting also mostly of poly-unsaturated fatty acids, but with a large proportion of alpha-linolenic acid, e.g. walnuts, flaxseed and a few others.<p>The rules for a healthy diet are simple:<p>1. Most of the fatty food eaten should belong to the second class from above, i.e. plant fat sources with mostly oleic acid<p>The reason is that this corresponds to the normal composition of the human body fat, so it can be used with maximum efficiency as an energy source or for cellular membranes, without requiring expensive transformations in the liver.<p>2. Any fat sources from the other classes may be eaten, but in smaller quantities.<p>3. The vegetable fat sources must be supplemented every day with a small quantity of fat containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (DHA &amp; EPA). The cheapest and most convenient way is to use cod liver oil or another kind of fish oil.<p>Rich vegans can pay 7 or 8 times more for a similar oil extracted from certain algae (algae is the commercially used word; it is not the most appropriate but there exist no more appropriate non-scientific names for those uni-cellular organisms).",general,finance,general

I actually have little interest in making great claims about consciousness, I just have to use it because the idea of <i>the flow of time</i> is made to be a conscious illusion instead of ontologically real by this very interpretation of the maths of physics. This is hardly my idea though, and I have been paraphrasing people like Harvey Brown, Tegmark, and Barbour the whole time. And the idea of a static block universe dates back to early 1900&#x27;s, and eternalism back to antiquity.

Of course a state machine will evolve deterministically based on some inputs.<p>Those are all described mathematically. But the mathematical laws of physics alone must then be interpreted in some way to describe reality. I mean look at the debate over which interpretation to apply to the same maths of QM for an example. Physics is not mathematics, it applies explanations.<p>And what these physicists above argue is that the math of the laws of physics does not necessitate an ontological, mind-independent flow of time to the universe. That we do experience a flow of time is not under question. We do. What is under question is that since the laws of physics (i.e. the math) works without an ontological flow of time (note: flow of time is a different idea than &quot;time&quot; or &quot;arrow of time&quot;, neither of which I am arguing about here. We are only talking about the flow of time), why do we have it. Well, they say, through the sequentialism of memories and physical, sensorial data. Nothing woo.<p>So no one is denying the flow of time as experience. Just like you can&#x27;t deny &quot;redness&quot; or &quot;hotness&quot;. They are experienced by us, but some also think we can explain them in naturalistic, scientific ways. And that will require a neuroscience perspective on some level.

In earlier posts I did say Barbour thinks &quot;time&quot; is a redundant term; needless baggage on top of just caring about particles and relations to other particles.

458,2021-05-18,"The core insight of Erlang is that having lots of little processes communicating over a message bus is a great way to design code. It also proves by demonstration a statement that many programmers, especially in the past decades, would have found hard to believe, that you <i>can</i> structure code as a whole bunch of relatively small self-contained services. Many programmers, perhaps even today, would not believe how far you can get with such a model, thinking that fairly massive monoliths are still really the only way to scale up.<p>Rather than specific examples, let me provide terms to google, as these are now such rich spaces that even a list of examples would be impoverish. Google &quot;message bus&quot;; there&#x27;s half-a-dozen solid production options you can deploy yourself, and all the major clouds have at <i>least</i> one option, often more.

Internally, consult your favorite language for monitors or restarts within a process; I&#x27;ve got one for Go called suture. Getting an idiomatic restart into a language depends on tons of details and I don&#x27;t have a good sense of the options across dozens of languages. Note this only really matters if your language and program is handling a lot of things at once in a single process, which is not always the case.<p>That&#x27;s most of what would matter, I think.

So what’s the idea?
A Social-First Messaging application that enables its users to share only once a day.
The app allows its users to share only once a day thus increasing significance of every post, creating an even playing field for all users and a unique content consumption pattern.
&quot;This is the single thing I can share with you today&quot; defines the relationship that exists between the creator and audience.
Why Now ?
1. Crazy consumer demand for a new medium
2. Many existing social apps are getting stale

1108,2021-05-22,"I&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time on &#x27;bad science&#x27; as a topic lately (check my comment history or blog for some examples). I think what you&#x27;re proposing is the opposite of what&#x27;s required.<p>Firstly, the problem here is not an epidemic of scientists who feel too financially insecure to do good work. Many of the worst papers are being written by people with decades-long careers and who lead large labs. Their funding is very secure. They are doing bad work anyway for other reasons, sometimes political or ideological, more often because doing bad work results in attention, praise and power. Or sometimes because they don&#x27;t know how to explain their chosen question, but don&#x27;t want to admit that scientifically they failed and don&#x27;t know where to go next.<p>Secondly, as you already realized your proposal relies on identifying which scientists have a proven track record, but the whole problem is that science is flooded with fraudulent&#x2F;garbage claims which are highly cited (&quot;proven&quot;) and which were written by large teams of supposedly respectable scientists at supposedly respectable institutions. Any metric you can invent to decide who or what has a proven track record is going to be circular in this regard. To Rumsfeld the problem, we are surrounded by &quot;unknown knowns&quot;. You say this is an open question but to me that&#x27;s a fatal flaw.<p>So the problem is actually the inverse. You say at the end, well, scientists who can fund their own work are an exception. Obviously in most cases scientists don&#x27;t need to do this, they can also be funded by companies. Most computer science research works this way. Better CPUs and hardware is done almost entirely by companies. AI research has been driven by corporate scientists, and so on. In contrast academic funding comes primarily from government agencies that distribute money according to the desires of academics themselves. This means a tiny number of people control large sums of money, and they are accountable to nobody except themselves. There are no systems or controls on academic behavior except peer review, which is largely useless because the peers are doing the same bad things as everyone else.<p>Viewed from an economic perspective academia is a planned reputation economy. The state is the source of all resource allocation decisions (academics being effectively state employees in most fields). There&#x27;s also a deeply embedded Marxist worldview: universities have no working mechanisms to detect fraud, because of an implicit assumption that deep down when market forces are gone everyone is automatically honest and good. The hierarchy is stagnant; the same institutions remain at the top for centuries. A good reputation lets them select the people with the reputation for being smart (e.g. by school grade), so that reputation accrues to the institutions, which lets them keep selecting intake by reputation and so on. E.g. supposedly Oxford and Cambridge are the best UK universities, they always have been, and they always will be. In a competitive, free market economy they would face competition and other institutions would seek to figure out what their secret is and copy it, like how so many companies try to copy the Toyota Way. In science this doesn&#x27;t happen because there&#x27;s nothing to copy: these institutions aren&#x27;t actually different.<p>This implies a simple solution: privatize it all. It would be wrenching, just like it was when the USSR transitioned to a market economy, just like it was when China (sort of) did the same. But one thing the 20th century teaches us is that you can&#x27;t really fix the problems of a planned economy by tinkering with small reforms at the edges. The Soviets weren&#x27;t able to fix their culture with glasnost and perestroika. They eventually had to give up on the whole thing. Replacing the current reputation economy with a real economy, with all the mechanisms that economic system has evolved (markets, prices, regulators, court cases, fraud laws etc), seems like a more direct and obvious approach to making things better, even if it may sound extreme.",general,general,general

930,2021-05-22,"I&#x27;d like to highlight the Introduction of nmcp.pdf which explains in a very compressed form how it works which encompass all the magic.<p>&quot;The lossless data compressor employs the traditional predictive approach:  at each time t, the encoder uses the neural network model to compute the probability vector p of the next symbol values t knowing all the preceding symbols s0 up to st−1. The  actual  symbol  value st is  encoded  using  an  arithmetic encoder  with approximately −log2 ( pst ) bits. Then the model is updated knowing the symbol st. The decoder works symmetrically so there is no need to transmit the model parameters. It implies both encoder and decoder update their model identically.<p>When  no  preprocessing  is  done, st represents  the  byte  at  position t. Hence there are Ns= 256 different symbol values from 0 to Ns−1.&quot;<p>For those usually familiar with Huffman coding this is using an Arithmetic coding <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arithmetic_coding"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arithmetic_coding</a><p>It allows adaptive coding (i.e. changing the probabilities of symbols dynamically). Here these probabilities are modelled dynamically using a neural network.<p>The magic is that the neural network parameters are defined implicitly : You don&#x27;t need to transmit the neural network parameters, therefore you can use as big as you want neural network.<p>During the decoding the from scratch network is continuously trained using the freshly decoded data, in the same way that it was during the encoding. The more data you compress, the more you train the internal neural network parameters, and the better the prediction for next character gets.<p>You decode 20 bytes, you update the model with this new data, you decode 20 new bytes with the new model, you update the model,... , every 1000000 bytes you can even update your model multiple times using all currently available data to make the network converge faster.<p>Of course this only works if everything is exactly deterministic, which Fabrice Bellard took great effort in guaranteeing, which is no small engineering feat.",web/mobile,general,AI/Data Science

1990,2021-05-22,"Hi! This is a fun question. Certainly, thermal equilibrium involves something called the equipartition theorem, which says that all of the energy is divided equally across all of the degrees of freedom so that each has an average small amount of energy which we call the temperature. (It&#x27;s hard to define temperature in any other circumstance! But let&#x27;s not get into ensembles.)<p>The big caution with the gradient idea is that you can get uncomfortably close, if you are not paying attention, to saying that refrigerators are impossible. An energy flow from degree of freedom A to degree of freedom B manages to “slurp up” some of this thermal energy from a system&#x27;s degrees of freedom and move them to another system, one gradient undoes a flow across a different gradient. And like, this happens all the time in everyone&#x27;s kitchen.<p>Information erasure looks like this: a bit needs to look like a degree of freedom with some energy stored above the baseline average. It could be energy neutral in that you might have two degrees of freedom, {ifZero, ifOne}, so that a NOT gate doesn&#x27;t take any energy, but just swaps the energy in the two degrees of freedom. But the energy stored in one or the other needs to be roughly one temperature*, or so. And the reason why is that “equipartition” specifies an average, but there is also a standard deviation: these are the energy fluctuations in thermal equilibrium. So, as a result of Ludwig Boltzmann we know that this is an exponentially-distributed random variable and therefore the standard deviation is equal to the mean. So if you want your bits to not be thermally excited, they need to hold a few temperatures’ worth of energy.<p>Information erasure says that the only circuits on these bits which preserve the energy levels inside them, are reversible circuits like NOT. Irreversible dynamics can look like reversible dynamics plus erasure: in the simplest erasure, we drain both ifZero and ifOne energies into the environment and then we refill ifZero from some energy reservoir. And this says basically that there is nothing much better than that for erasing a bit.<p>So, just like the ratchet had a spring that was kept at low energy in order to facilitate a transfer of energy from cold to hot, and could only work as long as you kept that spring well-refrigerated, Maxwell&#x27;s demon has a similar “coldness buffer” in terms of these bits that are present in a definite prepared state ahead of time. The information processing step takes it out of that zero state, and if it wants to go back there it has to erase, but that requires dumping some energy out into an environment, and getting energy from some reservoir to compensate. And then Maxwell&#x27;s demon becomes just a normal refrigerator like the other ones that we know about.",finance,general,AI/Data Science

He can literally retire after his options are fully vested, just 4 years after he joined (barring some catastrophic event to Snowflake withinin a couple of years&#x27; time horizon). AFAIK aiming for late-stage startups has been a common strategy for people trying to strike gold. Maybe it&#x27;s less valid nowadays? But it doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to me to say that working for a startup is 99% of the time worse than working for FAANG. &quot;Overrated&quot; it could be, and many startups, especially early-stage ones, suffer from a huge amount of uncertainty for people aiming for the liquidity event, which they may well underestimate.

If the company is willing to pay all employees the same amount of salary, regardless of where they live in the world, it could be a no brainer for somebody not living in the US to work for such a startup. The salary they get can easily exceed Google L4 total pay (e.g. in the UK and in Germany, not to mention in most other countries). Of course, many companies such as GitLab aggressively adjust their salary according to where you work from, but I&#x27;ve seen more and more companies that don&#x27;t.

I don&#x27;t know any distribution packager, so I can&#x27;t ask.

Maybe they should take a look at wlroots.<p>&gt; Even on the supported platforms it comes with a substantial burden on build requirements, calling for 10× to 100× or more RAM, CPU time, and power usage.<p>Obviously not. Some sessions on GPU acceleration being available nowadays, but that’s not a new development. The GNOME Wayland session has been demonstrated to be faster than the X session (many years ago on a Raspberry Pi).<p>&gt; Novel hardware which addresses issues like microcode and open hardware, like POWER9 and RISC-V, are also suffering under Wayland’s mainstream-or-bust regime.<p>Why? What does “mainstream-or-bust”? Probably not the protocol maintainers’ tendency to compromise on things to make Wayland not appealing to average users (ha).<p>&gt; Anyone left behind is forced to use the legacy Xorg codebase you’ve abandoned, which is much worse for their security than the hypothetical bugs you’re trying to save them from.<p>Xorg, by design and historical growth, is insecure. That said security fixes will of course continue to be shipped (I don’t say this with any internal knowledge of Xorg maintainable, only trust in the FOSS ecosystem). Of course, the user base is still huge.<p>&gt; Rewriting your code in Wayland is always going to introduce new bugs, including security bugs, that wouldn’t be there if you just maintained the Xorg code. Maybe there are undiscovered bugs lurking in your Xorg codebase, but as your codebase ages under continuous maintenance, that number will only shrink.<p>Xorg is insecure. Not because of bugs, but because of features people rely on.<p>&gt; Those of us who work with such systems, we feel like the Wayland community has put its thumbs into its collective ears, sung “la la la” to our problems, and proceeded to stomp all over the software ecosystem like a toddler playing “Godzilla” with their Lego, all the while yelling at us old fogies for being old and fogey.<p>I agree.

I thought the protocol was developing too quickly?<p>&gt; support more Xorg programs<p>The charitable interpretation is that it means “support more Xorg use cases”, which is completely valid. The way it’s said would also allow for the interpretation that the author hasn’t understood what Wayland is and wants X APIs added.<p>&gt; work on performance, stability, and accessibility<p>The protocol allows for very high performance. If individual compositors are inefficient, please talk to their maintainers. This isn’t an issue with Wayland in general. Same deal with stability. The compositor I use (wayfire) is super stable.  Unfortunately I can’t comment much on accessibility other than that I know that Linux has historically been pretty bad in this area.<p>&gt; Invest more in third-party implementations like wlroots.<p>With it defining the third compositor type besides KDE and GNOME I think wlroots is seeing an healthy amount of investment. What’s going too slowly for my taste is the standardization and adoption of wlroots protocols by other compositors (will GNOME ever care about what other people are doing? Will they stay incompatible forever?).<p>&gt; Your ecosystem has real problems that affect real people. It’s time to stop ignoring them.<p>I completely agree.

3327,2021-05-23,"I&#x27;m a customer (and I have no apps on the AppStore), and I constantly feel that the customer perspective is the best reason to want multiple AppStores: the Apple AppStore <i>sucks</i>.<p>1. Search is worthless. It&#x27;s basically only useful for exact string matches on app names. And even then, you get the competitor app&#x27;s ad that takes up 80% of the screen. They took every bad aspect of Google&#x27;s search (the confusing take-up too much space ads), with none of the good parts (you know, the actual searching smarts).<p>2. The review section sucks. Instead of providing a streamlined system to get help from the developer, they just give you a place to rant. Reading the reviews isn&#x27;t exactly ergonomic on a phone screen either, so it&#x27;s just a waste bin to throw complaints at. Imagine if Apple actually lived up to their lip service of app quality and integrated a support mechanism that would reward apps that promptly replied (they would be marked with the &quot;helpful developer&quot; badge and get more prominent search placement for example).<p>3. Discovery is non-existent. At some point in the last 5 years I kind of just stopped &quot;window shopping&quot; the AppStore. I used to think that the Top Charts were a lazy way to encourage trying new things out -- but wow, it was way better than what we have now. The first thing the AppStore shoves in my face is these absurdly long profiles on developers or whatever as if the AppStore is a magazine I want to read. I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t care about some editorial article about the makers of some game. And it takes up the entirety of the start screen instead of trying to customize a variety of app suggestions <i>just for me</i>.  This is such a missed opportunity. I would spend so much more money on the AppStore if it helped me at all to see new things. The experience instead requires you to be proactive to find things. Hence why it&#x27;s really just a glorified database that&#x27;s only really useful if you already know exactly what you want ahead of time.<p>4. It isn&#x27;t safe at all. There are so many scams on the store. Subscription scams, etc. Apple does this weird thing where they simultaneously pretend they don&#x27;t exist, <i>and uses them as proof that their arcane review system is needed</i>. If the store had no scams, they&#x27;d say &quot;see, our filters work!&quot;. If it does have scams, they say &quot;see, this is why the filters are so necessary, imagine how much worse it would be without them!&quot;. Anyways, as a customer, being &quot;on the AppStore&quot; no longer <i>means</i> anything to me from a quality or security perspective.<p>5. The UI feels generally like it was designed by a government bureaucracy or something. The tabs are: &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Games&quot;, &quot;Apps&quot;, &quot;Arcade&quot;, &quot;Search&quot;. The only tab that makes sense on first glance is Search (but then you find out how much the Search sucks). Why is there an &quot;Apps&quot; section in the &quot;AppStore&quot;? Aren&#x27;t they all apps? It&#x27;s like how there&#x27;s Apple TV+ in the TV app of Apple TV. And what the hell is the difference between Games and Arcade? 40% of the UI is dedicated to games, but split into two opaque categories, with &quot;Apps&quot; in-between them. And &quot;Today&quot; is of course this stupid magazine interface I&#x27;ve already complained about. It seems like it&#x27;s an infinite scroll interface of random bullshit, but eventually you do reach the end of &quot;Today,&quot; where you find how to redeem a gift card and read the Terms &amp; Conditions. All very &quot;Today&quot; items.<p>Anyways, the AppStore Tim describes only makes sense in the abstract. I wish they would just open the stupid store on someone&#x27;s phone in the trial and just try to use it.

Workloads without locality can incur a poor immediate performance because frequent cache misses lead to many translation-related reads and writes.Poor locality also impacts sustainable performance because data movement during garbage collection and wear-leveling requires translations and mapping updates<p>Aligned Sequentiality rule: clients of SSDs with hybrid FTLs should start writing at the aligned beginning of a block boundary and write sequentially. This rule does not affect immediate performance since the conversion happens later, but violating this rule degrades sustainable performance because of costly data movement during the delayed conversion.<p>Grouping By Death Time rule: The death time of a page is the time the page is discarded or overwritten by the host.

The couple of big issues this lead to is we never really did anything useful with the OTP application concept, no releases and what not, just hotloading with l&#x2F;1 in the shell; and maybe it took us a bit longer to figure out how to scale BEAM because we didn&#x27;t have anyone with that experience... But BEAM is written so nicely that people with experience optimizing C stuff can dig in and optimize BEAM without a huge learning curve, and most of the bottlenecks fit the same pattern of something simple that works fine at reasonable volume, but blows up consistently and clearly when you run it at large volume, so pretty soon you learn the pattern and know what to look for...

Let me respond to the most popular ones I&#x27;ve read in this thread and hopefully, I&#x27;m able to at least get some rational skeptics to at least re-assess their priors<p>Too Volatile To Be a Store of Value: Volatility alone doesn&#x27;t make something not a good store of value. Gold, a popular store of value is much more volatile than the US dollars but if you held gold from 50 years ago, you&#x27;d be up 37X against the dollar [0]. What makes something a good store of value is how scarce and easy to transfer both across space and time it is. Bitcoin can&#x27;t be blamed for the casino mentality, it&#x27;s up to market actors to use bitcoin as a store of value and from what I&#x27;ve observed, that&#x27;s going to be the long term outcome.<p>Bitcoin is slow: The argument that bitcoin is slow and expensive is a fallacy. Bitcoin is a settlement layer and when evaluating  the speed of a settlement layer, the emphasis should be on speed of settlement assurances and transaction finality[1]. Bitcoin being an open decentralized settlement layer makes this even more important. Comparing bitcoin to visa or sepa which don&#x27;t settle instantly is disingenuous at best and ignorant at worst. If you want faster transactions, use a layer 2 solution like the lightening network which is orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than visa [2].<p>Bitcoin is ponzi scheme: This is a complete fallacy both in theory and in practice and it&#x27;s pretty offensive to suggest that well-meaning people working hard to make finance open and globally accessible are a cabal of scammers looking to steal money from unsuspecting investors. Surely there are bad actors but that&#x27;s the case in any industry.<p>Don&#x27;t believe me? Bitcoin chainanalysis shows emphatically that the vast majority of coins that moved in this crash were new spends in the past months which shows that it&#x27;s the new buyers that are selling[3], where then is the pyramid scheme? In fact, The early adopters of bitcoin are the least likely to sell. I hold bitcoin not to sell and many in my network are like me(although I can&#x27;t speak for them). MSTR as an example hasn&#x27;t sold a single coin, in fact they bought more.<p>I could go on but it&#x27;s very exhausting that a technical forum is so negative towards an emerging technology with a lot of promise, it&#x27;s even more disturbing that a lot of the criticisms are uninformed.

6075,2021-05-25,"&gt; That&#x27;s the story that GC sold us. History has proven it wrong. Citation: the fire hose of articles on HN about how GC bit people in the ass, and they now have to go back into their code and write a bunch of duct tape code to work around Garbage Collector Quirk #4018 de jure that results in hitching, insane memory usage, and random OOMs.<p>I follow HN daily and very rarely do I see articles lamenting GC (I&#x27;m only familiar with a small handful of incidents including some pathological cases with Go&#x27;s GC on enormous heaps (many terrabytes) and some complaints about Java&#x27;s GC having too many knobs), certainly not in the general case. Indeed, for the most part people seem quite happy with GC languages, especially Go&#x27;s sub-ms GC. In particular, memory usage (and thus OOMs) have nothing to do with GC--it&#x27;s every bit as easy to use a lot of memory in a language that lacks GC altogether. This is incorrect, full stop.<p>&gt; I say GC is a failed experiment because it promised that programmers would be able to write code without worrying about memory.<p>GC promises that programmers don&#x27;t have to worry about freeing memory correctly, and it delivers on that promise. I&#x27;m not a GC purist--there&#x27;s lots of criticism to be had for GC, but we don&#x27;t need point at patently false criticisms.<p>&gt; The borrow checker is an infantile incarnation of a bigger idea that is finally panning out. Rather than garbage collecting during run-time; garbage collect during compilation using static analysis. Being in its infancy it&#x27;s not as easy and free to use as we&#x27;d like. But it&#x27;s the path forward.<p>Maybe. I like the idea, but I&#x27;m skeptical that putting constraints on the programmer is going to be an economical solution, at least for so long as the economics favor rapid development over performance. Conceivably rather than rejecting code that aggrieves the borrow checker, we could picture a language that converts those references into garbage collected pointers transparently, but we kind of have this already today via escape analysis--and indeed, I think this is the economic sweet spot for memory management because it lets users have a GC by default but also minimize their allocations for hot paths.<p>&gt; Hence my comment: &quot;A little bit of time spent now appeasing the borrow checker will pay off ten fold later when you don&#x27;t have to deal with exploding memory usage and GC stalls in production.&quot;<p>But the borrow checker is strictly less effective in preventing memory leaks than a (tracing) GC (borrow checker will happily allow circular refcounts). More importantly, having to pacify the borrow checker on <i>every single codepath</i> when only 1-2% of code paths are ever going to be problematic is not a good use of your time, especially when you can do some light refactoring to optimize. With respect to GC stalls, these are particularly rare if you have a GC that is tuned to low-latency (Go&#x27;s GC can free all memory in less than a millisecond in most cases).<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not about performance; it&#x27;s about saving yourself the time of having to come back to your code a month later because your TODO app is using a gig of RAM and randomly hitching.<p>That sounds like the textbook definition of a performance concern, but again memory usage is orthogonal to GC and random hitching isn&#x27;t a problem for latency-tuned GCs. Even while Rust is faster than many of its GC counterparts, this difference typically comes down to the ability of the compiler to output optimized code--not the memory management system. That said, for realtime applications, nondeterministic GCs aren&#x27;t appropriate.",web/mobile,general,web/mobile

By simply producing output that is JS bundler friendly we can just piggieback on Facebook&#x27;s Metro just like we piggieback on Webpack etc. when targeting the web.<p>We simply reuse the debug loader provided by Google Closure and load ClojureScript and Google Closure JavaScript files through the Metro server. But this is the core of ClojureScript&#x27;s hot-reloading capabilities without caveats. In Google Closure namespaces can be represented as nested JavaScript objects which delivers pervasive late-binding - which simply cannot be done with ES6 modules because imports will be captured (early bound).<p>The REPL bit (which is an independent piece from the hot-reloader) just runs on top of react-native-tcp-socket.<p>The only tricky part is that we need to be able to require Node libraries and assets into ClojureScript during development. This is done by a compiler pass - first we start at the entry point of the ClojureScript React Native project and follow the dep graph collecting all libraries requires from `node_modules`. This is dumped to a file that required transitively by `index.js`.<p>Asset handling is done as a simple compiler pass over every AST node searching for JavaScript `require` statements in the ClojureScript.<p>The end result is that we have an extremely rapid ddevelopment workflow that simply is not possible with other existing technologies - not React Native, not Flutter, not SwiftUI.

You don&#x27;t have to worry whether the actual number of colors is less than 256, how to posterize or filter the image to decrease that number, or how to suppress artificial colors from font anti-aliasing — the tool measures the visual likeness, and provides the means to set the acceptable limit so it would leave unsuitable images intact. Obviously, when you&#x27;re dealing with some long-term archival storage, or assets for further editing like stock clipart, such presentation-oriented lossy optimization should not be used.<p>Other automatic tools are referenced in the article, though you should treat them as a nice sanity check that prevents images holding raw uncompressed data or simple two color graphs saved as 4 byte RGBA from appearing in your project, and not a magical solution that would send it to the sky performance-wise.<p>Bandwidth (and loading time) is usually wasted on complex high resolution images like photos or combined graphics with photographic details.

them. Our forecasts help traders better align their use with power availability, who now do so on gut feeling or low-quality coarse-grained forecasts. We hope this
will increase the value enough to make transitioning to renewables more financially
appealing.<p>Most standard machine learning approaches struggle in particular with price forecasting due
to the limited data, large number of factors, heavy-tails, high noise, and underlying
complexity; even given the bids for each producer and consumer, solving for the prices
across a power network taking into account transmission, energy balance, and AC power
flow constraints relies on an NP-hard mixed-integer programming problem that can take
hours to solve. Of course in reality we don&#x27;t even know the bids ahead of time, and we still
haven&#x27;t won the battle against the heavy tails today!<p>Our pilot experiences with a major East Coast utility looking to trade power, a major New
England utility managing their demand response program, a battery storage operator in
Texas, and a wind trader in Texas, have shown us that every participant has differing needs
for their particular asset collection, so we dedicate time to each of our customers to make
sure that the product is tailored to their needs. Along the way we&#x27;ve developed a generic
forecasting system tuned for power markets to speed up customization, but we know we
have a long way to go before we support the full range of forecast granularity, location,
range, risk metrics etc we&#x27;ve heard interest for.
With over 3000 market participants operating in open electricity markets (including Texas,
California, New York, New England, and the mid-Atlantic), we’re hoping to hit 7 figure
revenue within the next year.<p>We need huge amounts of storage to facilitate a transition to zero carbon grids long term, so
we hope to minimize risk and maximize the reward for building new storage assets.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts, questions, and comments!",finance,devops/OS,AI/Data Science

Those machines came with very simple software and expected you to write some, rather than giving you thousands of pre-made packages to learn and play with.<p>A lot of existing software was video games. They were much simpler than those people play nowadays but they were still a lot of fun. Part of the fun was low latency.<p>I started working on a gaming console based on the raspberry pi that would have the kind of low latency that older home computers and gaming consoles had, and found a way to do that.<p>At some point, I realised that users would want to use a keyboard, read and write files, connect to the internet, stuff that is taken for granted with computers today.<p>So I wanted not to run on bare metal anymore, I needed an OS. Writing one from scratch would take me years and it probably would not be as good as an existing one.<p>But existing desktop operating systems tend not to be good for games, as they introduce latency and are able to stop a game at any time to do some other task, which can result in stuttering that the game developers cannot fully control or avoid.<p>I modified the OpenBSD kernel for the raspberry pi with gaming related extensions, in such a way that when the game runs there is no latency and no stuttering.<p>A game on my own fork of OpenBSD has the same performance of the bare metal code that I have written previously. And it can do file I&#x2F;O, connect to the net and all that kind of stuff.<p>And when you quit the game it&#x27;s just like normal OpenBSD so you can program it and make games yourself, browse the web and do all sort of stuff.<p>I am thinking that other people may want to have something like that, both for nostalgic reasons and for learning programming, so I thought of asking around and, if enough people like the idea, turn this into a product.",web/mobile,job/career,web/mobile

We’re a cataract surgeon and software engineer duo who are spearheading the at-home eyecare revolution. Our goal is to provide comprehensive eyecare to people at home, and as a first step, we&#x27;re tackling online glasses&#x2F;contact lens prescriptions renewals.<p>I (Quinn) started the company after I took care of a grandfather who tragically went blind during the Covid lockdown. This could have been prevented if he had had access to reliable at-home eyecare. During my training, I had seen countless similar scenarios play out around the country, but to have it happen in my own clinic was the last straw.<p>Eyecare is a weird and tricky space. On the one hand, there are legitimate reasons why eye doctors and their patients are tied to a physical office, and they mostly center on bulky hardware limitations (e.g. the slit lamp biomicroscope.) On the other hand, there are actually few legitimate reasons healthy people without eye disease need to be making routine in-office visits. In fact, the American Association of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends that folks with healthy eyes, good vision, and no risk factors for eye disease get a comprehensive exam just once in their 20s and twice in their 30s.<p>With this context, it’s absolutely wild that while millions of people are overexposed to eyecare via unnecessary pupillary dilations and air puff tests (which by the way are wildly inaccurate,) millions more can’t access even basic eyecare services, including refractions (aka the measurement of one’s eye prescription.) After all, 24% of U.S. counties have no optometrists or ophthalmologists!<p>Online eye exams are a first step toward addressing this pervasive access and resource allocation problem. We’re building our own version (feel free to play around with the prototype here: <a href=""""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.quadranteye.com&#x2F;va&#x2F;creditcard"""" rel=""""nofollow"""">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.quadranteye.com&#x2F;va&#x2F;creditcard</a> -- NOTE: please access via deskop&#x2F;laptop only!!!) which is an asynchronous exam that assesses your vision and eye health; the exam results, along with a glasses&#x2F;contact lens prescription uploaded by the patient, always get reviewed by an offsite MD&#x2F;OD. Our online exam is live and we&#x27;ve been renewing prescriptions for a few weeks now!<p>Unfortunately, online eye exams are limited in their scope and utility -- for one, they are unable to measure essential eye vitals such as pupillary response and eye pressure. These exams also happen to be extremely controversial, especially since they disrupt the traditional &quot;go into the eye doctor&#x27;s office, renew your prescription, buy your glasses&#x2F;contacts from your eye doctor&quot; model. For evidence that the $18B domestic optical industry stirs up strong emotions, check out this previous HN thread: <a href=""""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21653437"""" rel=""""nofollow"""">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21653437</a> (and dang tells us there have been many others!)<p>We believe online eye exams are a good catalyst for change, but they are definitely just a stepping stone. We’ve got our eyes on a much bigger vision — true at-home eyecare, including the ability to measure eye vitals — and we’re excited to have everyone follow along!<p>Thanks for reading and see you in the comments below. :)<p>Cheers,

I&#x27;m trying to create a cookie-less (beside the one needed to login) and I was wondering if there are ads services that don&#x27;t use cookies.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure it makes sense as a use case since I&#x27;m guessing personalization of ads will be harder (but not impossible) but maybe there is and I couldn&#x27;t find it."",""Ask HN: Is there an ads service I could use that doesn't use cookies?"")",web/mobile,finance,web/mobile

So, why ever work for anything other than your own company?<p>And, even if the &quot;talent&quot; takes a job at FAANG, what stops them from having a 2-year turnover rate where they make some money and then go risk starting their own company, and if that fails then just go back to making a steady paycheck?<p>The FAANG strategy for hiring talent seems to be something along the lines of: &quot;Sure, not all talent will be risk-averse, but a (large) percentage of talent will be, and we can grab those risk-averse talented people with higher-salaries than smaller companies.&quot;<p>In other words: if you are not a founder, relatively high-equity early employee, or a FAANG employee then you are game-theoretically either second-tier talent, really hate FAANG companies, and&#x2F;or you are not actually aiming high enough.",job/career,job/career,job/career

You can check out the full article here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secoda.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;measure-roi-on-data-discovery and calculate your own ROI on data discovery here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secoda.co&#x2F;measuring-data-debt<p>TLDR<p>Solving data discovery starts by getting on top of your team&#x27;s data debt. Data debt is a type of technical debt that is created when teams don’t catalogue, clean and categorize or organize their data. It drags down productivity and costs the organization in compute costs. This costs teams time and effort, but too many times, data debt is difficult to measure. There are two primary drivers that drive the cost of data debt and lead to understanding your need for a data discovery tool:<p>Discovery time: Data discovery time is the amount of time that it takes for your data engineering and analytics team to find the right data, understand what it means and use it to analyze the data request.<p>Organization time: This is the amount of time spent cleaning, documenting and organizing data to make it legible for other employees<p>You can measure the financial impact of data debt by looking at how much money it costs your team to discover and organize the data. We recommend calculating data debt as the hours spent discovering + organizing data * average cost per hour.<p>By having an idea of the cost of data debt, teams can more easily calculate their return on investment for a data discovery tool. Without the existing baseline, it’s much more difficult to get buy-in from the managers controlling the budget for your team. We hope this helps.",AI/Data Science,general,AI/Data Science

757,2021-05-19,"I appreciate your criticism! I never read much of Penrose, and find a lot of what he says outside of mathematics to be questionable. I also think I have an incredibly loose idea of consciousness and remain fairly uncommitted. I actually have little interest in making great claims about consciousness, I just have to use it because the idea of <i>the flow of time</i> is made to be a conscious illusion instead of ontologically real by this very interpretation of the maths of physics. This is hardly my idea though, and I have been paraphrasing people like Harvey Brown, Tegmark, and Barbour the whole time. And the idea of a static block universe dates back to early 1900&#x27;s, and eternalism back to antiquity. If I have failed and come off pretentious, that&#x27;s my fault and not theirs.<p><i>Of course there is state change</i>. Of course the sun will rise tomorrow. Of course a state machine will evolve deterministically based on some inputs.<p>Those are all described mathematically. But the mathematical laws of physics alone must then be interpreted in some way to describe reality. I mean look at the debate over which interpretation to apply to the same maths of QM for an example. Physics is not mathematics, it applies explanations.<p>And what these physicists above argue is that the math of the laws of physics does not necessitate an ontological, mind-independent flow of time to the universe. That we do experience a flow of time is not under question. We do. What is under question is that since the laws of physics (i.e. the math) works without an ontological flow of time (note: flow of time is a different idea than &quot;time&quot; or &quot;arrow of time&quot;, neither of which I am arguing about here. We are only talking about the flow of time), why do we have it. Well, they say, through the sequentialism of memories and physical, sensorial data. Nothing woo.<p>So no one is denying the flow of time as experience. Just like you can&#x27;t deny &quot;redness&quot; or &quot;hotness&quot;. They are experienced by us, but some also think we can explain them in naturalistic, scientific ways. And that will require a neuroscience perspective on some level. I only bring in consciousness to the extent needed, as it is intimately connected to our perceived &quot;flow of time&quot;.<p>We have to keep clear, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;flow of time&quot;, and &quot;arrow of time&quot;. In earlier posts I did say Barbour thinks &quot;time&quot; is a redundant term; needless baggage on top of just caring about particles and relations to other particles. That in turn morphed into how we can recreate the experience we all have of time-flowing if there really are only particles and forces - no magic of the mind.

It makes all this more convenient, and possibly scale better.<p>But what people really argue for is that it makes the system much less prone to corruption and manipulation, because the system of tracking is much more resilient to being tempered with.<p>For example, right now Joe Shmoe could fabricate a fake paper deed showing that his great grandma owned the Mona Lisa, and it is thus his. And then sue the French government saying they need to either buy it off him or return it to him. Now you&#x27;d need forensic experts and all to try and check the authenticity of that deed and all that.<p>Now this is a bit of a stupid example obviously. What if the deed was real? Would the government still say well oh crap here you go? I guess that will depend on the French government and their laws.<p>But say the laws of France were such that yes, it should indeed therefore be returned to Joe.<p>Well with blockchain, the idea is that this wouldn&#x27;t happen. First the &quot;deed&quot; would have never been lost, the ledger tells you who owns what, there&#x27;d be no confusion. Second, Joe (if he was lying), wouldn&#x27;t be able to create a &quot;fake&quot; entry in the ledger as easily as maybe he can fabricate a deed. Now that&#x27;s up for debate, but in theory a decentralized ledger need you to temper with all the nodes, so it&#x27;s possibly much more difficult to scam with.<p>And back to the example in the article, the Mona Lisa would be transfered from the government to Joe, there&#x27;d be a record of this. Now the question is no longer, is this record valid? We know this happened, the question becomes was this transaction initiated fradulently? Obviously the computer doesn&#x27;t know why the transaction came to be, just that it for sure did, not tempered with, no fake claims, this did happen and we know exactly from where and to where, and exactly what was it that was transacted.<p>Now you need people to investigate and asses if the transaction was fraudulent.

One element of this product costs $10. An enterprising person suggests that if 1% of the material submitted to the mfg line was counterfeit, but could be made to pass &quot;inspection&quot; they could make at least $10,000,000. They could resell the &quot;genuine parts&quot; on the grey market at a 50% markdown, but only pay 1% of the cost for the counterfeits. The product would ship. Company A would ultimately be left to deal with the 1% (but not trivial number) of unhappy customers and perhaps a class action lawsuit due to &quot;not meeting specs&quot;.<p>In the post I am responding to, there is no requirement by anyone to validate that a part is within spec. Current contract manufacturing for a lot of products does not involve the originating company being able to independently validate the product before it is shipped to the end user.

930,2021-05-22,"I&#x27;d like to highlight the Introduction of nmcp.pdf which explains in a very compressed form how it works which encompass all the magic.<p>&quot;The lossless data compressor employs the traditional predictive approach:  at each time t, the encoder uses the neural network model to compute the probability vector p of the next symbol values t knowing all the preceding symbols s0 up to st−1. The  actual  symbol  value st is  encoded  using  an  arithmetic encoder  with approximately −log2 ( pst ) bits. Then the model is updated knowing the symbol st. The decoder works symmetrically so there is no need to transmit the model parameters. It implies both encoder and decoder update their model identically.<p>When  no  preprocessing  is  done, st represents  the  byte  at  position t. Hence there are Ns= 256 different symbol values from 0 to Ns−1.&quot;<p>For those usually familiar with Huffman coding this is using an Arithmetic coding <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arithmetic_coding"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arithmetic_coding</a><p>It allows adaptive coding (i.e. changing the probabilities of symbols dynamically). Here these probabilities are modelled dynamically using a neural network.<p>The magic is that the neural network parameters are defined implicitly : You don&#x27;t need to transmit the neural network parameters, therefore you can use as big as you want neural network.<p>During the decoding the from scratch network is continuously trained using the freshly decoded data, in the same way that it was during the encoding. The more data you compress, the more you train the internal neural network parameters, and the better the prediction for next character gets.<p>You decode 20 bytes, you update the model with this new data, you decode 20 new bytes with the new model, you update the model,... , every 1000000 bytes you can even update your model multiple times using all currently available data to make the network converge faster.<p>Of course this only works if everything is exactly deterministic, which Fabrice Bellard took great effort in guaranteeing, which is no small engineering feat.",web/mobile,general,AI/Data Science

1990,2021-05-22,"Hi! This is a fun question. Certainly, thermal equilibrium involves something called the equipartition theorem, which says that all of the energy is divided equally across all of the degrees of freedom so that each has an average small amount of energy which we call the temperature. (It&#x27;s hard to define temperature in any other circumstance! But let&#x27;s not get into ensembles.)<p>The big caution with the gradient idea is that you can get uncomfortably close, if you are not paying attention, to saying that refrigerators are impossible. An energy flow from degree of freedom A to degree of freedom B manages to “slurp up” some of this thermal energy from a system&#x27;s degrees of freedom and move them to another system, one gradient undoes a flow across a different gradient. And like, this happens all the time in everyone&#x27;s kitchen.<p>Information erasure looks like this: a bit needs to look like a degree of freedom with some energy stored above the baseline average. It could be energy neutral in that you might have two degrees of freedom, {ifZero, ifOne}, so that a NOT gate doesn&#x27;t take any energy, but just swaps the energy in the two degrees of freedom. But the energy stored in one or the other needs to be roughly one temperature*, or so. And the reason why is that “equipartition” specifies an average, but there is also a standard deviation: these are the energy fluctuations in thermal equilibrium. So, as a result of Ludwig Boltzmann we know that this is an exponentially-distributed random variable and therefore the standard deviation is equal to the mean. So if you want your bits to not be thermally excited, they need to hold a few temperatures’ worth of energy.<p>Information erasure says that the only circuits on these bits which preserve the energy levels inside them, are reversible circuits like NOT. Irreversible dynamics can look like reversible dynamics plus erasure: in the simplest erasure, we drain both ifZero and ifOne energies into the environment and then we refill ifZero from some energy reservoir. And this says basically that there is nothing much better than that for erasing a bit.<p>So, just like the ratchet had a spring that was kept at low energy in order to facilitate a transfer of energy from cold to hot, and could only work as long as you kept that spring well-refrigerated, Maxwell&#x27;s demon has a similar “coldness buffer” in terms of these bits that are present in a definite prepared state ahead of time. The information processing step takes it out of that zero state, and if it wants to go back there it has to erase, but that requires dumping some energy out into an environment, and getting energy from some reservoir to compensate. And then Maxwell&#x27;s demon becomes just a normal refrigerator like the other ones that we know about.",finance,general,AI/Data Science

31,2021-05-17,"Thanks for the information. Would you mind elaborating on what made things &quot;really, really, really messy&quot;?<p>Our use case is fairly typical, basically an SPA doing the heavy lifting, an API on the back end to support it, and then some largely static marketing pages. There is a potential fourth aspect if we want to customise any of those back end pages depending on who is logged in, for example to personalise help pages with the user&#x27;s own details or to host some account management pages separate to the SPA.<p>Next is under consideration because our SPA will be React-based, so being able to share components and styles for the rest of the site could be quite a time saver. We&#x27;re reasonably sure we want to use some Node-based back end for this project, because that would allow us to share substantial functionality between the SPA and API implementations, but this would still apply if we used Express or another alternative to Next.<p>It looks like the SPA and static pages wouldn&#x27;t be a problem with Next in your experience, but maybe there could significant problems we haven&#x27;t anticipated so far with using Next for the API and&#x2F;or with using server-side rendered but not entirely static content?",web/mobile,general,web/mobile

33,2021-05-17,"&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest, an Intel Core 2 Duo would obviate most programmer workloads just fine.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely not the case. At least for my workflows. My work-issued five year old Intel i5 XPS would get incredibly slow, and incredibly hot when running unit tests or compiling code in Angular. Goes without saying that a Core 2 Duo would be simply unusable.<p>My personal machine was a 2018 i5 MacBook Pro. On that machine I could open just <i>one</i> iOS Simulator or Android Emulator and expect to have merely decent performance. And by decent, I mean the system would be running hot, the fans would be loud and the system would be noticeably slower. Having multiple simulators or emulators open is simply not a thing this Intel notebook was willing to do. Meanwhile on my M1, I&#x27;ve ran six iOS Simulators &#x2F; Android Emulators at once, and the system did not slow down, <i>at all</i> (for reasons discussed in this article).<p>In a futile attempt to push my M1 to its limits in a dev workflow, I even trained TensorFlow models on it. Surprise, surprise: not only was the model trained in a decent time (for a notebook without a dGPU; I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles), but it did all this without any perceptible slowdown in system performance. The absolute worse thing I could have said about the M1s performance here was that the MacBook Air&#x27;s chassis got <i>a little</i> hot. And keep in mind that when I way <i>a little</i> hot, I mean that it still produced less heat than my Intel notebooks often produce when watching a 4K YouTube video (and it does this all without a fan!).<p>So in short, no, the Intel Core 2 Duo would absolutely not be fine for my programmer workloads. And, yes, the M1 has pretty much obviated Intel&#x27;s lineup for my work. Dare I say, the M1 MacBook Air has been the single biggest quality-of-life upgrade I&#x27;ve had as a developer.

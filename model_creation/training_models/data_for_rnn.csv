"&gt; I don&#x27;t think so, as you can embed allmost any math concept in a real world context.<p>Not without adding a lot of complexity. What I meant is that the concepts taught in maths very rarely map directly to any real world problems. GPU programming is a good example, it uses a lot of vector related maths but the leap from not knowing about vectors to GPU programming is huge and not a good way to learn the subject, since you would have to think both about the complexity of GPU&#x27;s and graphics and about the vector abstraction at the same time. The reason you had fun doing GPU programming is because you already knew about the interface of vectors so you had no problems working with them.",AI/Data Science

"Where they get you is that it very rarely makes financial sense to do both cloud and colo&#x2F;on-prem (unless you&#x27;re a massive company).  It ends up being way more expensive to use the cloud, but also hire engineers to work on making an on-prem cloud.  Most companies have a mixed bag of projects that are either better served by the cloud, or are okay with colo and the savings it can bring.<p>Assuming you don&#x27;t want to do a hybrid approach, then you either push everyone onto the cloud and accept paying more, or you push everyone into colo and force the small and scaling out projects to deal with stuff like having to order hardware 3 months in advance.<p>Then, depending on how nice you want it to be to interact with your infrastructure, you can end up paying a lot to have people build abstractions over it.  Do you want developers to be able to create their own database from a merge request or API call?  If so, now you&#x27;re going to have to hire someone with a 6 figure salary to figure out how to do that.  It&#x27;s easy to forget how many things are involved in that.  You&#x27;re going to have a lot of databases, so you need a system to track them.  A lot of these databases are presumably not big enough to warrant a full physical server, so you have to sort out multi-tenancy.  If you have multi-tenancy, you need a way to handle RBAC so one user can&#x27;t bork all the databases on the host.  You will also need some way to handle what happens when one user is throwing so much load at the RDBMS it&#x27;s impacting other apps on that database.  To accomplish that, you&#x27;re going to need a way to gather metrics that are sharded per-database and a way to monitor those (which is admittedly one of the easier bits).  You also generally just straight up lose a lot of the scaling features.  I don&#x27;t have a way to just give you more IOPS to your database on-prem.  The best I can do is add more disks, but your database will be down for a long time if I have to put a disk in, expand the RAID, let it redistribute data and then power it back up.  That&#x27;s several hours of downtime for you, along with anyone who&#x27;s on the same database.  Of course, we can do replicas, and swap the master, but everyone will have to reconfigure their apps or we need something like Consul to handle that (which means more engineers to manage that stuff).<p>You&#x27;re also probably going to need more than one of those expensive infra people, because they presumably need an on-call rotation, and no one is going to agree to be on-call the time.  And every time someone quits, you have to train the new person, which is several months of salary basically wasted.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that you don&#x27;t need infra people on AWS, but you a) need a lot less of them, because they only need to manage the systems AWS has, not build them, and b) you can hire cheaper ops people, again because you don&#x27;t need people that are capable of building those kinds of systems.<p>Once you factor in all of that stuff, AWS&#x27; prices start looking more reasonable.  They&#x27;re still a little higher, but they&#x27;re not double the price.  If anything more than a tiny, tiny subset of the AWS features are appealing, it&#x27;s going to cost you almost as much to build your own as it does to just pay Amazon&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;whoever.<p>Also, a massive thing people overlook is that AWS is fairly well documented.  I can Google exactly how to set up permissions on an S3 bucket, or how to use an S3 bucket as a website.  It only takes seconds, the cognitive burden is low, and the low-friction doesn&#x27;t cause anyone stress.  In-house systems tend to be poorly documented, and doing anything slightly outside the norm becomes a &quot;set up a meeting with the infra team&quot; kind of thing.  It takes forever, but more importantly, it takes a lot of thought and it&#x27;s frustrating.",devops/OS

Another option would be for them to copy the approach used by firefox, and use dlopen to access gtk functions and draw the CSD that way when it&#x27;s detected they&#x27;re running in a GNOME environment.

GTK used to be fairly vendor neutral, it was the &quot;<i>GIMP</i> ToolKit&quot;, not the Gnome toolkit. It worked with any desktop environment you chose to use. Since then they&#x27;ve been making the toolkit much more dependent on Gnome specific features and actively been making the lives of everyone else more difficult.<p>Also there are a lot of controversial decisions that make developers lives annoying, like [refusing to implement classic typeahead](<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;nautilus&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;244"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;nautilus&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;244</a>) instead relying on their search daemon which is really annoying for a lot of developers, and of course makes running a GTK app in a non-gnome desktop much worse. There are a few outstanding issues that make it annoying for developers to work with file paths under Gnome.<p>So yeah, they&#x27;ve burnt a lot of developer good will and seem intent on continuing that trend.

Or &quot;I just got this delivered yesterday and I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it looks really great!&quot;... 5 stars.<p>These are then immediately followed by a 1 star review along the lines of &quot;This is the biggest piece of junk I&#x27;ve ever bought online.

It&#x27;s a serious problem with the platform. I usually search for reviews written by people who have had the product for a week or two and give the pros&#x2F;cons along with a less than 5 star rating.

"Indeed, it&#x27;s arguable that things that cost money will tend to come from an industry that&#x27;s flush with money. So I can&#x27;t really dispute your point.

The apps might have been more klunky, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s important. For instance, I would be happy to receive my daily news in a giant flat text file, and don&#x27;t need the features that generate &quot;engagement&quot; or tell me what other people are reading.

"The questions this is trying to answer really aren&#x27;t that hard...<p>&gt; Why have telemetry at all?

You have no information about this?  Don&#x27;t you think instability would be reported by users?<p>&gt; It is difficult for us to estimate the size of the user base accurately.<p>You can get an &quot;estimate&quot; by tracking the number of downloads along with some far less intrusive metrics like user agent, etc.<p>&gt; We need a way to make informed decisions about which OS versions to support. For example, can we raise the minimum version of the macOS to 10.10 to update the wxWidgets to the latest version?<p>Again track the user agent and you&#x27;ll have an idea.<p>Also, generally speaking no you should not raise the minimum OS version on a ubiquitous piece of software like this.

We found it with the great help of the community members on our forum. However, there is no way for us to estimate the impact of these issues on users. Is it just a random case?

Both FreeBSD and Linux implements this VFS API with a layer called Solaris Porting Layer (SPL).<p>The original Illumos-upstream FreeBSD ZFS, this SPL layer was implemented as a kernel module (opensolaris.ko). OpenZFS originally maintain this shim in other repo, but later incorporate this shim into its codebase. FreeBSD port of OpenZFS involved importing SPL layer from FreeBSD tree into OpenZFS. On this part, there&#x27;s not much difference in nativeness of the port.<p>However, this SPL layer also serve the purpose of adding one degree of separation between GPL code and CDDL code in order to comply with GPL in order to prevent ZFS code from becoming a derivative of the Linux kernel. The shim in OpenZFS is in three licenses; the Linux part of SPL is GPLv2, the FreeBSD part is 2-BSD, and the part that interacts directly with ZFS code is CDDL.<p>This is the area where FreeBSD can be more native with regarding to ZFS. Since CDDL is compatible with BSD license, FreeBSD kernel and its userland can integrate directly with ZFS without any licensing issue, e.g., FreeBSD bootloader simply linked against ZFS, whereas GRUB2 must implement a part of ZFS in order to do probing.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freebsd.org&#x2F;AndriyGapon&#x2F;AvgVfsSolarisVsFreeBSD</a>",devops/OS

"&gt;The parent said debt based economies. The US has an economy and government system that is increasingly drowning in debt (check out the corporate balance sheets in the US; nationally it&#x27;s horrific;<p>Yes, that is what happens when your currency is the world reserve currency. Every nation exports their products to you but they never want to import anything from you. Therefore you run into a domestic unemployment problem and you must take on an increasing amount of debt just to keep your economy stable. That&#x27;s the &quot;exorbitant privilege&quot; the privilege to be forced to take on debt.<p>It&#x27;s called a privilege because smart leaders recognize that you can have your cake and eat it too but neither Obama nor Trump have taken advantage of that, all they did was let the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. Trump merely wanted to reduce the disadvantages by starting a trade war with China.<p>&gt;that situation has been spurred on by the Fed&#x27;s forever low interest rates,<p>Those low interest rates aren&#x27;t spurred by government debt. They are spurred by low inflation, if possible the interest rates would be at -1% or deeper but things like treasury bonds, cash and in theory Bitcoin prevent interest rates below 0%.<p>&gt;which encourages corporations to take on ever greater sums of debt because it&#x27;s artificially cheap, which will ultimately lead to zombies ala Japan).<p>Yes, those corporations are supposed to grow their business and employ people, even if those companies are useless to society, because the beneficial effects of employment will completely outweigh the downsides of zombie companies. However, inflation never came and unemployment is taking forever to shrink. (precovid of course)<p>&gt;The Federal answer to that is to print ever increasing sums of fiat USD, because there are no foreign buyers left that can absorb tens of trillions in new US government debt.<p>There are lots of foreign buyers for USD though which drags inflation way down.<p>&gt;The Fed unavoidably becomes the primary buyer of the US Government&#x27;s debt (this is where a nation begins eating itself; that began for the US over a decade ago now as a trickle, that trickle is picking up pace).<p>This argument makes sense when the debt is fueled by Trump style tax cuts because you are ruining your ability to pay the debt back in the future, I mean, how are you supposed to pay the debt back if not by raising taxes above previous levels?<p>If you spend it on one time stimulus the risk of the debt growing only exists until the economy has recovered. If you spend the money on infrastructure you can actually net a greater return in the future.<p>&gt;Once upon a time not so long ago it was a huge deal that China held a trillion dollars of US government debt, now that sum is a joke, a mere portion of one spending program this week or next. That&#x27;s how quickly the US is imploding fiscally.<p>It&#x27;s a huge deal in the sense that it obligates the Fed to increase the money supply and the government to increase debt as mentioned in my first point. China buying US government debt IS the problem, in the sense that it forces the US government to go into more debt. If China is actively hurting the US economy, it is doing so by buying US debt which means it is not importing products from the US, which means China is not creating jobs in the USA. If China ever decides to unwind its US debt only good things will happen to the US economy.",finance

"I think the idea of money as credit is very interesting (look at my HN comment history for my ramblings on the topic!).<p>&gt; I think the system described is interesting, but for regular human commerce purposes, I think the downsides of it (managing IOUs from many different parties, needing to have a trust-path between users that could steal from you, needing to keep a node online always or trust your money to someone else who does so) make it less useful than cryptocurrencies. Having a common currency between many different parties is much easier to work with than trying to figure out a workable way to value IOUs from many different parties. Needing an established trust-path between users seems like a large obstacle in the internet age where I might suddenly want to transact with anyone on the planet.<p>You are right, these are disadvantages but other than &quot;trust paths&quot; the complexity can be mitigated with:<p>1. Market makers who buy IOUs at a discount and swap them for _their_ IOU which can be more trusted. Essentially you want a little bit of centralisation around parties which are known to always make good on their liabilities. These parties could be fully automated (think like Ethereum DAO) and transparent. In some ways these market makers are like banks of today but instead of lending their credit into existence, like banks do, they require people to buy it (usually) at a premium.
2. Insurance or a credit derivatives market so people can hedge against counterparts defaults.
3. If everyone agrees on a common numeraire and wallets are sophisticated to show an aggregate balance in that numeraire taking into account credit risk then that could remove much of the complexity for users. Integrated with market makers, you could &quot;auto swap&quot; IOUs to issuers which you prefer. Wallets can also provide a credit risk break down on all counterparts. Agree this is more complicated than current notions of money.
4. Securitisation markets. Package up IOUs into tranches. Traders can speculate on various levels of credit quality.
5. Sensible reputation management. Non-invasive performance tracking of debtors. Did they meet margin requirements? Did they meet all coupon payments? Etc. Can also take into account degree of co-operation with other users, for example do they accommodate restructuring and help others meet their liabilities?<p>I don&#x27;t like crypto because there&#x27;s essentially zero accountability for issuers and that kind of environment is optimal for scammers. Crypto behaves like synthetic equity&#x2F;commodity instruments with no accountable issuers. In contrast, with a credit based system, issuers are responsible for their issued liabilities and are expected to make good on them. In crypto, no-one thinks in terms of liabilities and so you get ridiculous projects like &quot;Synthentix&quot; who are collateralising a USD Stablecoins with their own issued tokens. For anyone with a basic understanding of financial risk and accounting, their approach is mad.<p>A credit based system is fairer because anyone can issue credit and the onus in on issuers to ensure they have the necessary reputation for others to accept their credit. Furthermore, credit-like instruments are natural Stablecoins - providing all agree on a numeraire, the value of credit is a function of credit risk which can be successfully managed in most cases.",finance

"It&#x27;s interesting that HN does not like Bitcoin, yet HN is one of the most technical places on the internet. 13 years ago I was working on MapleStory Emulators in C&#x2F;C++ at the age of 16 and was extremely overconfident in my abilities. Around the same time Bitcoin came out and I brushed it off since I was too cool for Bitcoin.

If there is not demand from the economy those reserves will not be lend, ergo, they will not be inflationary (they could affect other financial assets prizes though).<p>3. Apart from keeping the interest rate where they want, adding reserves to the system will happen when the fed buy assets from the banks (they are payed with reserves).

"With the AstraZeneca vaccine (and presumably J&amp;J would be similar) a consideration is that the side effects you see might actually have to do with the platform itself.<p>Unlike the mRNA platforms, these vaccines use an existing virus to make the spike proteins. Specifically, an Adenovirus (so the sort of thing that might be implicated in some colds) but which ordinarily thrives in Chimpanzees instead of Humans, so they can have confidence you aren&#x27;t immune to it already. The virus is altered to tell human cells to make the protein chosen by the engineers (for COVID-19 this was the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus); and not more copies of itself, once the copies in the vaccine injection are cleaned up (typically a few hours to a few days) the virus is gone, so you can&#x27;t &quot;catch&quot; the virus.<p>But of course your immune system has no particular reason not to destroy this (harmless) Chimp virus meanwhile, it shouldn&#x27;t be in your body, so it&#x27;s every bit as much a target as the spike proteins we want immunity against.<p>Thus, it&#x27;s certainly possible any fever one particular patient suffers is a side effect from their immune defence against this poor harmless chimp adenovirus, and nothing to do with SARS-nCOV-2 or its spike protein. No way to tell for sure I believe.",general
"This is why economic thinking should be a part of every team&#x27;s process. One of the major problems with technical projects is that many people can give an estimate of their value but only the developers can give an estimate of the cost—and they can usually only do that effectively after some iterations and starting to sketch out the problem. Usually organizations just ignore this problem and try to fix the cost upfront, which is where the whole &quot;mythical man month &#x2F; hours&quot; phenomenon comes from. In a well-functioning Lean&#x2F;Agile&#x2F;whatever-you-want-to-call-it organization, there should be a constant ongoing evaluation of the work and its cost&#x2F;benefit, and that should be updated as the devs learn more about the problem. When you do this, ideas are no longer &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot; they just have a value estimate and can be evaluated against other ideas. (And you can factor in things like switching costs when people throw out something totally new.)",general

"Think about how absolutely insane some assumptions would have to be for this to be a problem.<p>These are the kinds of things that separate commercial software from open source software: in many organizations, commercial programmers typically write to a spec, and the specs usually come managers asking for specific, needed things without both a proper understanding of the larger picture and a nuanced understanding about how those specific pieces intimately fit in to the larger picture.<p>Open source is usually written by people who take pride in what they write, so even though a 32 bit timer for millisecond events almost certainly won&#x27;t still be running 50 days after you&#x27;ve started a program, they&#x27;d still consider, &quot;What if it overflows?

"The trouble is that the reality is probably closer to it simply not being financially worthwhile for manufacturers to offer the lower-end variants anymore - in the case of cars, partly because they&#x27;re legally required to include these features, but also because the incremental cost of adding those new features shrinks. That is, rather than the cost of a 1990s base-model remaining the same and people just getting higher-end models, the cost of a 1990s base model increases closer to that of more feature-filled models to the point it doesn&#x27;t make sense to make the features optional. If you think about the cost of making, say, a fancy entertainment or sat-nav interface, that&#x27;s gone down in a way that the cost of huge chunks of carefully machined, stamped and welded metal hasn&#x27;t.<p>Also, the definition of a high-end variant changes over time too. For example, today a 52-inch TV fills the same price niche that a 32-inch one did, say, a decade ago but it also fills the same quality niche - you need to buy the 52-incher to get the same kind of audio and picture quality as a 32-inch set from years gone by, and the 32-inch sets have deteriorated in quality in ways that aren&#x27;t necessarily visible from the obvious spec-sheet numbers.",general

"Serialized novels used to be common, though. Many of Dickens&#x27;s novels were famously serialized weekly. Alexandre Dumas&#x27; famous novels The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers were also published as serials. There are plenty of other examples. More recently, apparently In Cold Blood and Bonfire Of The Vanities were both initially published as serials.<p>Even today, comic books are effectively serialized narrative stories that are pretty reliably published on schedule and have writers who have to keep up for months at a time.<p>&gt; Authors tend to have phases of inspiration, and lulls in between.<p>Different writers have different approaches to work. Some writers work in highly productive sprints with long fallow periods, and you&#x27;re right this model probably wouldn&#x27;t work well for them. But some novelists do work steadily (Stephen King I believe still tries to write for a couple hours every single day and only takes relatively short breaks between novels), and the fact that this model used to work for a number of books that are now considered classics seems to indicate it can still work in at least some cases.<p>I&#x27;d actually be more worried about the consumer side - the death of magazines makes this model tougher. A given author can reliably produce a novel over the course of a year or two, perhaps, but probably not indefinitely (comic books solve this problem by having writing teams do arcs and then swap out the writer). Magazines used to bundle multiple authors, so subscribers weren&#x27;t affected by the break period of a single author. In a world where people subscribe to individual authors on Substack and there&#x27;s no bundling of many authors writing, yeah, it&#x27;s a tougher sell.",general
"It is worth noting that back then songwriter and performer were basically separate jobs, and it was very common for multiple artists to record the same song, sometimes even at the same time and competing on the charts. Hound Dog is written by Lieber and Stoller, the legendary songwriting duo, and recorded by multiple artists, including Thorpe and Elvis. The performer only got paid for their own performance, but the songwriters got paid for every recording (depending on the contract).<p>All this changed with Beatles and Bob Dylan, because they made it the expectation that &quot;real artists&quot; wrote their own material. This caused the idea of the &quot;original version&quot;, and consequently the &quot;cover version&quot; which was a recording by any other artist than the original writer&#x2F;artist.<p>So not to dispute that Rock n Roll was originally black music which made a lot of white artists rich and famous, it is still interesting to note how many of the songwriters at the time were Jewish.",general

"I did mention Alexandre Dumas as a case study in a previous article. Here&#x27;s a snippet:<p>&quot;But there used to be another way. When Alexandre Dumas debuted The Count of Monte Cristo it was published as a feuilleton—a portion of the weekly newspaper devoted to fiction. From August 1844 to January 1846 his chapters were published in 18 installments for The Journal des Débats, a newspaper that went out to 9,000 to 10,000 paying subscribers in France—and readers were rapt by it.<p>In the forward to a 2004 translation of the book, the writer Luc Sante wrote: “The effect of the serials, which held vast audiences enthralled… is unlike any experience of reading we are likely to have known ourselves, maybe something like that of a particularly gripping television series. Day after day, at breakfast or at work or on the street, people talked of little else.”<p>It was basically “Game of Thrones.” Readers could not wait to get their hands on the next chapter and that bode very well for the writer who was not only paid by the newspaper in real-time for his work (by the word), but also grew the popularity of his work over the entirety of the time it was being published.<p>“The ‘Presse’ pays nearly 300 francs per day for feuilletons to Alexandre Dumas, George Sand, De Balzac, Frederic Soulé, Theophile Gautier, and Jules Sandeau,” Littell’s Little Age, Volume 10 wrote in 1846. “But what will the result be in 1848? That each of these personnages will have made from 32,000 to 64,000 francs per annum for two or three years for writing profitable trash of the color of the foulest mud in Paris?”<p>That “profitable trash” earned those writers an annual salary of between $202,107 to $404,213 in today’s dollars—and the obvious disdain of that Littell writer who, even then preferred the merits of a bound and published book. The same volume goes on to say that Dumas earned about 10,000 francs ($65,743 today) per installment when he was poached from The Presse by The Constitutionnel in 1845.&quot;<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ellegriffin.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;publishing-industry-truth"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ellegriffin.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;publishing-industry-truth</a>",general

The definition of what variant is &quot;clinically relevant&quot; is layered, context-dependent, and (partially) regulated. Software is responsible for automating away the majority of variants, say down to 10-100, in a justifiable, traceable way.

"I analyzed about 200 #BuildInPublic twitter accounts, collected the best practices of #BuildingInPublic and grouped them into categories. Hope you find it useful.<p>1)Tell how you cope with struggles
Glossy stories repel. And do you remember at least one popular film without overcoming problems and difficulties? Great tool for building trust, and relationships.
 2)Tell what has changed through experience
Creating something creates a new experience that changes us and the way we work, it&#x27;s a great thing to share.
3) Engage your readers in the process
Interactivity is a great opportunity to captivate readers.
4) Ask
Here we are not talking about questions to engage the audience, but to find expertise for your project - involve in the product, not in the tweet.
5) Shine a light on what&#x27;s behind the scene
Most of the work on the product is not visible to customers, but this does not mean that it should not be shown.
6) Story of today
Life is not always a routine, unusual events or experiments are a great opportunity to share them
7) Tell how you feel
Tell about your feelings about creating something.Creation is always a gamut of emotions.
8) Breakdown metrics&#x2F;milestone
Dry numbers are not catchy, but how you achieved this is a completely different story.
9) Uncover the value of a new feature
Do not tell what you did, tell what it will give to the user
10)Harsh truth
Moving forward, we often see and feel the hidden side.#BuildinPublic is a great opportunity to show it. Honesty wins.
11)Show your toolbox
Thor has a hammer, Captain America has a shield, but what do you have?
12) We all are people
We all have ups and downs. This is completely normal and part of the creation of any product

"Most estimates of greenhouse gas emissions are misleading. Cows might emit methane and co2, but that carbon came from their food, and that carbon in their food was captured from the air, so it&#x27;s actually a cycle without net increase in carbon in the air.

The only real net emissions in the process of creating beef are the fossil fuels burned in the process, from transportation.<p>This distinction between real carbon emission, and carbon cycle is important because there&#x27;s misguided notion of how much of a real difference it would make if people stopped eating meat. The decrease in emissions will be offset by a decrease in carbon capture from their food, and the net difference will be much less than assumed.<p>Moreover, if the process of creating meat replacements requires more fossil fuels to be burned than the natural process of growing food and feeding cattle, it might be that alternative meats are detrimental to the environment. I haven&#x27;t seen a fair comparison of the net emissions of the whole process, they always count the cows farts without discounting for the carbon capture while growing their food.",general

"Andrew Huang does a good job of explaining harmonics and overtones[0].

Our ears hear the root tone, and the other tones above it are what give the sound its uniqueness.

Having to share the remaining money with siblings, grandchildren, charities, and any other individuals or organizations in a parent’s will could further reduce a child’s take. And a parent who has remarried might leave assets to a new spouse, diminishing or eliminating what children expected to receive.<p>&gt; DEI initiatives rarely advance strict racial quotas or thumb on the scale affirmative action policies.<p>This is not accurate. DEI initiatives seeks to increase <i>diversity</i> in hiring by changing the hiring criteria to hire more of favored identities (inclusion) while promoting favored identities to achieve equal outcome (equity).<p>But DEI does not apply positively to black viewpoint opponents of social justice such as libertarians and conservatives.

"Nicholas has <i>Waded</i> (pun intended) into the waters of irrational horror over gain-of-function research that seems to <i>gain viral traction</i> following every spill-over event. The only argument presented in the article that leans towards the lab-leak hypothesis is the human-preffered double CGG codon that appears in the furin cleavage site; this is nothing like a smoking gun, IMO. Yesterday&#x27;s TWiV 751 covered a paper <i>The furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is required for transmission in ferrets</i> [1] which has the following abstract:<p>&gt; To investigate the importance of the spike polybasic CS of SARS-CoV-2 (PRRAR), a number of spike mutants predicted to modulate the efficiency of furin cleavage were generated (Fig. 1a), including: substituting two upstream arginines to produce a monobasic CS similar to SARS-CoV spike (monoCS), replacing the tribasic CS with the furin CS of a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza haemagglutinin containing seven basic amino acids (H5CS) and two naturally occurring deletions seen following passage in Vero E6 cells and&#x2F;or in clinical isolates21,26. The first deletion removes eight amino acids including all three arginines of the PRRAR site (ΔCS), while the other removes five flanking amino acids but retains the tribasic CS (Δflank). The mutations were engineered into a spike expression plasmid to enable cell surface expression and generation of coronavirus lentiviral PVs. In addition, to study the importance of the PRRAR motif in the context of live virus, we used a naturally occurring Vero-cell-adapted mutant SARS-CoV-2, ΔCS26. This variant and the wild-type (WT) virus from which it was derived were cloned by limiting dilution to enable studies using individual genotypes.<p>This is the <i>horror</i> of in vitro and in vivo viral lab research and the result is a magnificent advancement of our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the furin cleavage site, and its role in TMPRSS2 assisted membrane entry. This research follows the equally eye-opening paper covered in TWiV 715 that explained why hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) failed; Vero E6 cells lack TMPRRS2 so HCQ fully blocks entry via endocytosis. It should be noted that this study includes MERS-CoV which also has a furin cleavage site; falsifying one of the claims of Wade&#x27;s article.<p>Regardless, lab experiments begin with one or more viral isolates and molecular clock techniques should show that the original Wuhan variant has almost identical non-coding genome segments compared to existing lab isolates. The RaTG13 sequence is a very distant relative using this measure. Also, RaTG13 is not an isolate, only an RNA sample collected in wild bat anal swabs. Conflating viral isolates with RNA samples seems to be a common error; an entry in a genetic database does not imply that a viable viral line exists in a lab. A RaTG13 lab isolate would have been an important achievement to further our scientific understanding.<p>I&#x27;m confused by the dismissals of the natural origins hypothesis. The horseshoe bat roosts, that are studied, are mostly found in or near Kunming, Yunnan. This lush wild area is part of the Lancang&#x2F;Mekong River watershed&#x2F;ecosystem shared by nocturnal bats and nocturnal arboreal mammals like palm civets, pangolins, and raccoon dogs. The nearby villages contain people engaged in guano collection, the wildlife trade, and domestic livestock farming.<p>The average incubation time of COVID-19 is 4.5 days. Armed with Google maps and a basic understanding of planes, trains, and automobiles we can gauge travel time from Kunming Airport to either Wuhan Tianhe International Airport (2 hr 5 min) or Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (2 hrs). In 2003, SARS-1 emerged in Guangzhou (near Hong Kong) and the now demonized Dr. Zheng-li Shi and her team traced the origins to palm civets (the intermediate host). Why is this so hard? Why do we not ridicule the assumption that travel between major Chinese transportation hubs must leave a wake of infections along the path?<p>Finally, Wade&#x27;s article mentions a U.S. State Department claim [2]:<p>&gt; The U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.<p>If true, this is an important early super-spreader event but the remainder of the release consists of a facile analysis performed by people more knowledgeable in geopolitics than science.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-021-00908-w"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-021-00908-w</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2017-2021.state.gov&#x2F;fact-sheet-activity-at-the-wuhan-institute-of-virology&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2017-2021.state.gov&#x2F;fact-sheet-activity-at-the-wuhan...</a>",general

"I’m not dumping on Ilhan Omar.

She’s welcome to have whatever politics she wants—it’s America! But it’s wrong for the media to amplify her as if she is representative of Muslims in America as a whole.<p>This is a problem with progressives, which have disproportionate power in the media, and academia. As a group (for example Elizabeth Warren supporters) they’re as disproportionately white as the Republican Party. But they trade on the moral authority of purporting to speak for people of color. To that end, they amplify voices like Omar and Tlaib, whose politics are indistinguishable from those of secular white progressives, and not representative of Muslims. There are probably more Muslims who voted for Trump (about 1&#x2F;3) then ones who are as extreme in their politics as Omar and Tlaib. This pisses odd people like my parents, who are typical Muslim voters (moderate socially conservative Democrats).<p>It’s particularly problematic when, as the OP points out, whites people are judged differently for amplifying the voices of someone like Omar or Tlaib versus the voice of one of the many Muslims who voted for Trump. It suppresses conservatism within the community—progressive Muslims can count on getting tenure, getting in CNN, because white people are allowed to agree with and amplify them. But when conservative Muslims speak, white people are afraid to agree, and progressive whites often feel comfortable attacking them as tokens.

"Historically the very best software engineers outside the US simply immigrated to the US, joined a Silicon Valley company, and made a good living. The quality of those left behind, who didn’t have the same mobility, was on average lower. So companies didn’t have good reason to open an office elsewhere. This was especially true before the Internet, since collaboration was much more difficult. These days there are probably great engineers in many locations, but it takes time for their local tech economy to catch up to locations with concentrations of employers and employees like Silicon Valley. They need employers to open local offices (attracted by cheaper or better talent), and then for competing employers to also do so, in order to change the supply demand dynamics to favor software engineers. Then their salaries will rise accordingly.<p>Another part of the equation: in today’s age of massive aggregation around a few gigantic tech monopolies in the US, those few companies are able to pay large salaries because they derive a lot of value from their employees. But the reality of compensation is not very dissimilar between the US and other locations once you remove FAANG from the equation. FAANG companies employee a very highly selectively chosen segment of software developers who can command high value, but are also a tiny slice of the market. But the majority of software engineers in America are not employed in FAANG or compensated that way.",job/career

- I coded less and less, managed more and more, so I would have to go for team lead roles, but I am young and have not much prior experience.
- I really loved, for the lack of better words, having so much impact and freedom. Can joining anywhere as employee give me the same, especially in bigger orgs?<p>Those of you having had similar experiences, where did you go next, and what advice can you give me?

For example I worked on an application doing calculations and rendering on the GPU in Rust (I learned almost everything for that on my own. I really like Rust now).<p>This is also why I dislike web development (impossible to build well optimized web applications). Maybe embedded programming is something for me?<p>I&#x27;ve also always been fascinated by game development (I made a few small games myself), sadly it&#x27;s not paid that well, but thinking about a concept, building a game around it (with help from a friend for art) and letting people play it is an amazing feeling. I hope to have enough free time next to my job to keep doing that.<p>I am also interested in computer graphics in general, for example algorithms like raytracing, raymarching, so I wonder what your thoughts are on working on a game engine or a renderer for movies.<p>My grades of the first semester were okay (2-3) in math (I am doing a math minor) and good (1) in computer science modules. I really like to learn and come up with algorithms and to prove theorems (I liked analysis and linear algebra). What are your thoughts on going into research?<p>Maybe AI, machine learning or computer vision are something for me, but from my research it looks like most of the job consists of collecting and cleaning up data and feeding it into an existing learning engine, not actually implementing or improving the engine. Also it sounds to me like &quot;AI&quot; is over-hyped.<p>So I think that sums up most of what I can tell you about me.

"I wrote the terminal canvas renderers in VS Code that has been called out a few times here. Initially I implemented a canvas renderer using just a 2d context to draw many textures which sped things up &quot;5 to 45 times&quot;[1] over the older DOM renderer.<p>Since then I moved onto a WebGL renderer[2] which was mostly a personal project, it&#x27;s basically the first canvas renderer but better in every way since it works by organizing a typed array (very fast) and sending it to the GPU in one go, as opposed to piece meal and having the browser do its best to optimize&#x2F;reduce calls. This was measured to improve performance by up to 900% in some cases over the canvas renderer, but actually much more than that if for example the browser has GPU rendering disabled and tried to user the canvas renderer on the CPU.<p>My opinion here is that canvas is a great technology, capable of speeding things up significantly and getting close to native app performance. It comes with very real trade offs though:<p>- Cost of implementation and maintenance is much higher with canvas. This is particularly the case with WebGL, there have been very few contributions to xterm.js (the terminal frontend component) in the WebGL renderer because of the knowledge required.
- Accessibility needs to be implemented from scratch using a parallel DOM structure that only gets exposed to the screen reader. Supporting screen readers will probably also negate the benefits of using canvas to begin with since you need to maintain the DOM structure anyway (the Accessibility Object Model DOM API should help here).
- Plugins&#x2F;extensibility for webapps are still very possible but requires extra thinking and explicit APIs. For xterm.js we&#x27;re hoping to allow decorating cells in the terminal by giving embedders DOM elements that are managed&#x2F;positioned by the library[3].<p>More recently I built an extension for VS Code called Luna Paint[4] which is an image editor built on WebGL, taking the lessons I learned from working on the terminal canvas renderer to make a surprisingly capable image editor embedded in a VS Code webview.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;03&#x2F;terminal-renderer"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;03&#x2F;terminal-rend...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;updates&#x2F;v1_55#_webgl-renderer-is-the-new-default"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;updates&#x2F;v1_55#_webgl-renderer-...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xtermjs&#x2F;xterm.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1852"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xtermjs&#x2F;xterm.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1852</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=Tyriar.luna-paint"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=Tyriar.l...</a>",web/mobile

Oh, and to top it off, users don&#x27;t want to pay for any of that.

"Hi everyone! My name’s Aly, and I’m the founder of UPchieve (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upchieve.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upchieve.org</a>). I’m here with UPchieve’s CTO, Dave (thedevelopnik). We’re an edtech nonprofit that provides free, 24&#x2F;7 online tutoring to low-income high school students.<p>The idea for UPchieve was based on my own personal experience as a low-income student. I was raised by a single mom who was an immigrant to the US and often couldn’t help me with schoolwork and applying to college. So I went to a community college, and from there it took me 6 years to transfer to and graduate from a 4-year university.<p>College is not the only way for a low-income student to achieve upward mobility, but research shows it’s one of the most reliable. That was the story for me, too. Transferring to Penn helped me get a job on the trading floor at J.P. Morgan, where I immediately made 3x as much as my mom straight out of college.<p>I soon began looking for ways to give back and help other students like me get to college. Volunteering as a math tutor seemed like a great choice because I had tutored my way through HS and college and knew a lot about it, but I couldn’t find any existing volunteer opportunities that fit with my work schedule.<p>That’s when I first came up with the idea for UPchieve: an open source platform that could meet the needs of both younger-student-me (who needed help with schoolwork and college apps, often late at night in my home) and older-volunteer-me (who needed a flexible and convenient way to give back). Students can use UPchieve 24&#x2F;7 to request and get paired with a live tutor in 5 mins, and volunteers select their availability and then wait for a text notifying them that a student needs their help. You can see a demo of both the student and volunteer side of the platform here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SufRUje0XiM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SufRUje0XiM</a><p>Over the next two years, I realized that many other people cared about what I was doing and wanted to volunteer to help build the platform and tutor students. I also learned more about the state of education in the US and discovered that the gap in college completion rates between low- and high-income students hadn’t changed at all in 10+ years! This led me to grow more and more passionate about both the need for and potential of a platform like UPchieve. In 2018, I finally quit my job at J.P. Morgan to work on UPchieve full-time, with the new goal of scaling free tutoring to all low-income HS students across the US.<p>UPchieve is completely free for eligible students, and it only costs us $10 to give one student an entire year of unlimited academic support. For reference: online tutoring companies charge students $35 per hour on average. Other existing nonprofit tutoring models are prohibitively expensive and difficult to scale, due to factors like 1) cost of paid tutors, 2) in-person delivery, and 3) long-term commitments required of students and tutors.<p>We’re also working to become 100% self-sustaining (i.e., not dependent on donations). Companies like Verizon and Goldman Sachs pay us to provide virtual volunteer opportunities to their employees. Many big companies have budgets set aside specifically for volunteer opportunities because studies have found that employees who volunteer are more likely to stay at the company.<p>So far, we’ve helped more than 7,000 students and matched more than 30K on-demand requests for tutoring. My favorite part of my job has been reading the hundreds of comments we get from students each month, telling us how we’re helping them kick ass in their classes and that they can’t imagine life without us. It’s literally the best feeling ever. You can see some of my favorite student feedback here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1w3nqHSNiP-2270_Qxjvy367oRAU9Cn03gSJh7dGT5Lw&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1w3nqHSNiP-2270_Qxjvy...</a><p>If you like what we’re doing and want to help, please consider signing up to volunteer—we especially need more statistics, calculus, and physics tutors!

"I&#x27;m not talking about fair share of the profits - the OSS project, I hope, has no profits.<p>Babel, in particular, is a project that&#x27;s primarily interesting to software development companies. It&#x27;s not consumer-facing software like Signal or Firefox or GNOME or whatever. It&#x27;s not the logic for a self-driving car or a pacemaker. It&#x27;s a tool that&#x27;s for software developers who want to write in one version of JavaScript and have code run in an environment that expects another version of JavaScript.<p>I would agree with you for things like Signal or Firefox - that while there&#x27;s theoretically a monetary value for me being able to use them, it&#x27;s difficult and weird to pin down that number, and it&#x27;s a social good to have them available for free.<p>But there&#x27;s a very non-theoretical monetary value for companies that use Babel. They can develop software x% faster, and they pay $y per unit time to develop software, so the value is x times y. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if the company using Babel makes any profit: their costs are lower because they use it.<p>And, corresponding, Babel isn&#x27;t a social good like Signal or Firefox. It doesn&#x27;t make the world a better place on its own. It makes the world a better place insofar as people using Babel are trying to make the world a better place and they can do so faster. (Or it makes the world a worse place if people using Babel are trying to make the world a worse place.)<p>So it&#x27;s up to the people using Babel, all of whom have significant engineering funding, to make sure it continues to exist and work. And they should be doing so on a scale commensurate with the cost savings they get from Babel. Which is to say, they <i>will</i> do so, provided that the danger of Babel not existing is real, and the possibility of avoiding that fate with funding is real - it&#x27;s in their rational self-interest to do so.<p>Or, in other words, the framing of &quot;funding sufficient to keep a project alive&quot; as &quot;fair share of the profits,&quot; and the idea that closed-source software companies can reasonably expect &quot;profits&quot; and open-source projects used by those companies cannot, is itself the crisis. We have no way of talking about funding apart from profit. Either we need to come up with one, or we need to admit that the only way to solve the open-source funding crisis is giving up on open source.<p>If we can&#x27;t figure out how to employ more than one person on Babel when its users&#x27; rational self-interest would be to fund it to the tune of many millions of dollars a year if they had to, is it any surprise Signal is pivoting to cryptocurrencies and Firefox is pivoting to VPNs?",web/mobile

"It is really interesting and I am looking forward to updates (subscribed, starred, etc). Having something built on top of Rust is full of potential too. I am also curious if something that separates indexing and querying code into separately-deployable modules is an interesting architecture, suitable for static site generators and search on the edge.<p>The one issue I have is a comparison positioning with Elasticsearch.

More focused on actual search and less on log management.<p>I get that maybe the blog was written with the more &quot;popular keywords&quot; in mind, but maybe here some additional technical details could be shared.<p>Specifically, a comparison with Lucene (or Solr). Especially, since Tantivy architecture is based on Lucene&#x27;s. And - AFAIK - Lucene&#x27;s index segments are read-only, by its core design. And a lot of &quot;clever index optimizations&quot; Elasticsearch article talks about is actually at the Lucene&#x27;s level. And Lucene is very modular with different implementation for DirectoryReader, Posting formats, etc.<p>Similarly, shard management and request routing is in SolrCloud. Position encoding are in core Lucene. NLP is done by OpenNLP in Solr. The Parts-Of-Speech information can be added to tokens with Payloads.<p>So, it would be interesting to hear the comparison starting from that point.<p>Finally, Lucene comes with the benchmarking module. I saw you mention &quot;twice as fast&quot; in another reply, something that compares apples to apples would be interesting. I understand that Rust may be faster, but Lucene also has decades of investments in memory structures and algorithm optimizations.

The backend system that processed those claims—the one written in COBOL—hadn’t been to blame at all.<p>One can bet good money on the expectation that the mainframes will be the last component of a system to crash and burn.

C is very minimal and embedded developers are very reluctant to use <i>any</i> third party code so you end up with a lot of triangular and square shaped wheels so to speak.

After all the goal is not to develop nice abstractions, it&#x27;s to make a product that can be sold.<p>I would say C++ is an amazing language for library authors who are necessarily talented and spend the time to create robust, easy to use, and well thought out abstractions that can make the life of an application developer vastly easier.<p>Of course your mileage my vary as I&#x27;m sure the wider software world doesn&#x27;t have all of the same problems that embedded has.

"&gt; An access trough a pointer is less efficient than a direct access<p>But the alternative is <i>not</i> &quot;a direct access.&quot; It&#x27;s <i>a copy and then</i> direct access. A copy, mind you, that occurs <i>through a pointer</i> to grab the original data from the stack position it was sitting in. That&#x27;s the <i>very same</i> indirect read that the callee does in the proposed ABI!<p>Thus, the indirect memory <i>read</i> will happen either way; either at caller copy time (existing ABIs), or at read time (proposed ABI, copy optimized away), or at callee copy time (proposed ABI, copy not optimized away.)<p>The only difference in the number of indirect memory accesses, with the proposed ABI, is that you might be able to avoid an indirect memory <i>write</i> (i.e. of the memory the caller is writing to by doing the copy.)<p>&gt; Finally, who guarantees that the programmer doesn&#x27;t abuse this thing and starts to modify the data without doing the copy on write?<p>Uhh... we&#x27;re not talking about features exposed to the developer. We&#x27;re talking about calling conventions—instructions <i>to the compiler</i> on how to distribute the <i>glue code it generates</i> between the call-sites it builds (&quot;caller-[verb]ed&quot; things) and function prologues&#x2F;epilogues it builds (&quot;callee-[verb]ed&quot; things.)<p>The &quot;copy on write&quot; part here [if you want to call it that—it&#x27;s not &quot;on&quot; write] would be part of such a generated function prologue (&quot;callee-copied&quot;)—the same code that gets generated at the call-site in existing calling conventions (&quot;caller-copied&quot;), just moved to the other side of the linkage. With the important difference that, if the compiler could prove that the callee (or anything it calls, passing the variable, transitively) wasn&#x27;t going to do anything write-like with the data behind the pointer, then the copy in the function prologue could be optimized out.<p>This compiler optimization can only occur if the copy is the callee&#x27;s responsibility. Given external linkage (think: separate compilation units, e.g. calling a function defined in a static library that&#x27;s already compiled and only available in binary form), the caller can&#x27;t guarantee the properties of the callee. But a callee can always guarantee <i>its own</i> properties during function-prologue&#x2F;epilogue generation—since it&#x27;s generating the function prologue&#x2F;epilogue in the very same compiler session that has access to the AST that describes the function&#x27;s static-analysis-proven properties in full.<p>(Yes, this means that a compiler could <i>be mistaken about</i> whether a callee writes through the implicit pointer underneath the passed value, and therefore generate the optimized function prologue when it shouldn&#x27;t. This is known as <i>a compiler bug</i>, and wouldn&#x27;t be something J Random Hacker would ever run into if using a stable, non-alpha release of their compiler, with a stable, non-alpha release of support for this calling convention.)<p>&gt; What cleanliness?<p>The functionality being proposed is that you just pass-by-value (which makes obvious that the semantics your code is enacting is &quot;the function can do whatever it likes with the value, and it won&#x27;t affect the caller, because <i>if it writes</i>, it&#x27;s writing <i>to a copy</i> of the value&quot;); but sometimes it&#x27;ll be automagically faster than it could have otherwise been, because sometimes, when the compiler can prove certain properties, no copy — only an indirect memory read — would be occurring.<p>This allows you to <i>always use pass-by-value</i> when you want those semantics, and to get code that&#x27;s &quot;as optimal as it can be&quot;; rather than having to pass pointers around and explicitly copy-on-write and all that mess in order to get that same level of optimization.<p>(And yes, that&#x27;s the alternative in heavily performance-oriented code like a database&#x27;s tuple materialization logic. You don&#x27;t get to write clean code at the expense of performance.

"My biggest problem using Nix has been minor changes, like the address of upstream sources, rippling down through dependencies. Hopefully this will improve with content addressing, and make it easier to fetching from places like IPFS. As an example:<p>- I wrote a piece of software as part of a research project, which I kept in git and built using Nix.<p>- That tool was generally useful, so I didn&#x27;t want to pollute its repo with my particular experiment scripts&#x2F;results, etc. so I kept those in a separate repo which pinned a particular commit of that tool.<p>- The writeups&#x2F;papers based on these experiments had a lot of churn (as usual), so I kept those in a third git repo, which pinned a particular commit of the experimental results. These writeups did some analysis, generated graphs, etc. which was also managed by Nix.<p>This all worked great, everything was reproducible, identified by unforgable git commit IDs, etc. Then Microsoft bought GitHub and a bunch of people&#x2F;projects deleted their repos (e.g. moving to GitLab, or wherever). That broke the tool&#x27;s build, making the whole chain from tool -&gt; experiment -&gt; paper unreproducible. It was easy enough to fix by swapping the URLs in the .nix files, but that changed the git commit ID; hence the existing experimental data was tied to a commit which didn&#x27;t work.<p>Content-addressing would:<p>- Allow monkey-patching a fix, by letting me declare that both commits produce the same tool (despite their sources containing slightly different .nix files), and hence this change doesn&#x27;t alter the experimental results.<p>- Allow such issues to be prevented, by making it easier to fetch dependencies from content-addressed storage like IPFS, which reduces the reliance on third-party servers keeping URLs alive; e.g. I could keep hosting the desired sources myself.

That flexibility allows the free movement and sharing of code, but it is key in that movement that the system does not force a single idea of truth.<p>The blockchain allows new and old nodes to participate in a process of agreeing on a central truth.

"SELinux is nothing but a maintenance burden for developers and users. There&#x27;s a reason no major distro beyond the Fedora line that enables it by default, including the one I work one; it almost invariably frustrates users, has incomplete support for the workflows they use, and so they turn it off anyway. I literally turned off SELinux on my new ARM64 Fedora machine last week, because it prevented me from installing a third party binary (which I am a developer of.) That binary in turn needed its own ability to use namespacing support to sandbox applications (in a manner that works and offers enhanced security on any Linux distro, not just SELinux ones), etc. It&#x27;s a non-starter.<p>&gt; Since that’s generally believed to be the case, no sandboxing is necessary.<p>That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re wrong. It&#x27;s necessary even if you believe it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s been proven time and time again that this is the case and that the &quot;belief&quot; no flaws exist is wrong.<p>Sandboxing approaches that use techniques like namespaces, and capability security have become vastly, vastly more popular over the years on Linux, and they&#x27;re going to keep getting more popular, precisely because they work where SELinux fails (that is, 98% of the running Linux systems and distros that actually exist). Browsers, WebAssembly, systems like Flatpak with &quot;Portals&quot; -- all of them have moved into capability-inspired and &quot;component&quot; sandboxing approaches, to achieve this level of security independent of the host operating system.

It started out as a nights-and-weekends project, out of personal frustration with ElasticSearch&#x27;s complexity for doing seemingly simple things. So we set out (maybe naively at the time), to see what it would take to build our own search engine, just to scratch our intellectual curiosity. Over the years, we&#x27;ve realized that it takes a LOT of nuanced effort to build a search engine that works well out of the box.<p>Our goal with Typesense is to democratize search technology on two fronts:<p>1. Simplify and reduce the amount of developer effort it takes to build a good search experience that works well out of the box. To this end, we pore over API design to make it intuitive and set sane defaults for all parameters.<p>2. Make good instant-search technology accessible to individuals and teams of all sizes. To this end, we decided to open source our work and make it completely free to self-host. We also optimize for reducing the operational overhead it takes to deploy Typesense to production (eg: single binary with no runtime dependencies, one-step clustering, etc).<p>In 2020, I left my full-time job and my co-founder left his full-time job a month ago, and we&#x27;re now both working full-time on Typesense.<p>Happy to answer any questions!",devops/OS

Tech like KCP[1] is an early indicator of this interest, in using the soul of kubernetes if not it&#x27;s specific machinery, by creating an independent, non-Kubernetes, but Kubernetes compatible API Server. Having universal storage, having autonomic system control are huge advantages when system building, and gaining those benefits is fairly easy, with or without Kubernetes itself.<p>I&#x27;m hoping we see a DIY cloud&#x27;ing become more of a thing. Leaving everything in the hands of hyperscalers is a puzzling and hard to imagine state of affairs, given the hardware nirvana we&#x27;ve experienced in the past two plus decades. Kubernetes is the first viable multi-system operational paradigm, the first diy-able cloud we have, and it&#x27;s shocking it took that long, but smaller practitioners getting good at converting their sea of individual boxes into something more resembling the Single System Image dreams of old, albeit through a highly indirect Kubernetes-ish route, is a decade or decades long quest we seemingly just started in to a couple years ago.<p>I&#x27;m hoping eventually ubiquotous and pervasive computing starts to dovetail with this world, that we start to have better view &amp; visibility of all the computing resources around us, via standardized, well known interfaces. Rather than the hodgepodge of manufacturer controlled, invisible, un-debuggable overlay networks that alas, constitute the vast majority of the use of the internet these days. Alas the news  there is never good, the new Matter standard is, like Thread, inaccessible, unviewable; consumers are expected to remain dumb, ignorant, unaware of how any of it works, merely thankful for whatever magic they receive[2][3]. But as a home-cloud, as the manor re-establishes computing as base &amp; competency for itself (#ManorCompute), &amp; as good projects like WebThings[4] or whatever takes it&#x27;s place light the darkened damp corridors only robots patrolled, I hope for a reawakening, hope a silent majority becomes more real &amp; known, hope the fed up, sick of this shit, disgusted with remote-service-based technology world starts to manifest &amp; apply real pressure to emerge a healthy, pro-human, pro-user ubiquotous &amp; pervasive computing that gives us an honest shake, that shows what it is, that integrates into our personal home clouds.<p>I think there&#x27;s a huge pent up demand &amp; desire for flow-based&#x2F;evented systems, for Yahoo Pipes, for Node-RED[5]. The paradigm needs help, I think there&#x27;s too many missing pieces for something like Node-RED to be the one, but re-emerging user-control, giving us ALL flexible means to compute, is key. Exposing &amp; embracing some level of technical literacy is something people want, but no one knows how to articulate it or what they want. We&#x27;re mired in a &quot;faster horses&quot; stage, and it&#x27;s fundamentally incorrect.<p>Last, I have huge hopes for the web. There are incredibly awesome advances being made in the range of peripherals, devices, capabilities the web supports. The web can do so much more. We&#x27;re barely beginning to use the cutting edge ServiceWorkers, barely beginning to use Custom Elements (&quot;WebComponenets&quot;), and these aren&#x27;t even that new any more. These are fundamentally revolutionary technologies. Things like File System Access just came back on the scene after over a decade of going nowhere. Secondary screen working group is tying together multiple systems in interesting ways. There&#x27;s a lot of high-tower shit, in WebAssembly (especially when Interface Bindings starts to allow real interop with JS), in TypeScript, but to me, I think rather than just building up up up there&#x27;s some very real re-assessments we ought to be making about how and what we build. Trying to make self-documenting machines, trying to make computing visible, these aren&#x27;t concerns of industrial computing, but they are socially invaluable advances that have been somewhat on hold in the age of Pax React-us, and we&#x27;re well over half a decade in &amp; while there&#x27;s endless areas to learn about, improve, get better at in this highly industrialized toolset, I want to think there are some slumbering appetites, some desires to re-assess. I&#x27;m a bit afraid&#x2F;scared of WebAssembly being a huge tower-of-babel time-sink&#x2F;re-industrializing-focus that distracts from the need for a new vision quest, but I have hope too, I see the yearning. Albeit often expressed in lo-fi counter-culture, which to me is a distraction &amp; avoidance, rather than the socially empowering act that has been a quiet part of the web&#x27;s promise[6].<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kcp-dev&#x2F;kcp"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kcp-dev&#x2F;kcp</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staceyoniot.com&#x2F;project-chip-becomes-matter&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staceyoniot.com&#x2F;project-chip-becomes-matter&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27123944"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27123944</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webthings.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webthings.io&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodered.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodered.org&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webdevlaw.uk&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;why-generation-x-will-save-the-web&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webdevlaw.uk&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;why-generation-x-will-save-t...</a>",devops/OS

"Well, I guess you can consider a manufacturer to be either an actual manufacturing company that sells directly to wholesalers or retailers OR a company that owns a brand which purchases product in bulk to sell to wholesalers or retailers.<p>Either way, a lot of companies want their products to be seen in a certain &quot;class&quot; of products, and it&#x27;s harder to maintain that brand image from a pricing standpoint if everyone can just sell it at whatever they want.<p>So, what happened at this large discount cigar place is that, like I said, they were doing something similar to Wal-Mart&#x27;s strategy: sell a ton of product at a low profit margin and force manufacturers to come down in prices as a result.  The manufacturers hated it because (a) their existence relied on the good will of this corporate behemoth, and (b) supplying so much product to the discounter meant less was available around the country for retail shops, which is essential to building brand loyalty.  When Leegin happened, the discounter begrudgingly admitted that they would be forced to raise prices. But not before buying out a few accessory manufacturers.<p>While not as popular as simply discounting cigars, it sorta worked for them. They would sell a box of cigars at the lowest price that they could and then include a free humidor to store them in. And what collector of stuff doesn&#x27;t want another container for their stuff?<p>I&#x27;ll say too, that some manufacturers simply refused to do business with the volume discounter until after Leegin.  They had built up a market for themselves with independent shops without needing to go to the volume discounter... but after they could be ensured that their prices would be stable, they opened the floodgates.",finance

"The process of balancing production capacity with sales demand is referred to as capacity planning and it is used across the FMCG industry, from food supply chains to many more.<p>It is an essential aspect of manufacturing. Besides production, the grocery supply chain management can be applied to almost any FMCG endeavor with difficulty meeting demand.<p>The logistics management software solutions also extend to service sectors, retail and commercial sales, information technology, government agencies, and so on.<p>Software in this industry is most often used to arrange production to meet short- and medium-term needs, but it&#x27;s also an integral part of long-term strategic and organizational planning.<p>Formal preparations and run-throughs of the entire supply chains occur once per year in most organizations. This isn&#x27;t ideal and an iterative model of the operation, which takes into account market demands, production capabilities, and order fulfillment, can be fulfilled better with the help of production capacity planning software.<p>What Is warehouse inventory management software? How does it work?<p>Capacity planning is the process of deciding a production line, operation department&#x27;s, or function capacity to satisfy a specific demand over time across FMCG and the food supply chain. This includes using grocery supply chain software in the steps that must be taken to change the system&#x27;s ability to satisfy demand.<p>This can then be used to evaluate a capacity plan that not only satisfies demand but also meets certain requirements such as lowest overall cost, highest throughput, and on-time delivery.<p>Source:- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;throughput.world&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-ai-powered-capacity-planning-is-improving-manufacturing-landscape&#x2F;",finance

Glossy stories repel. And do you remember at least one popular film without overcoming problems and difficulties? Great tool for building trust, and relationships.
 2)Tell what has changed through experience
Creating something creates a new experience that changes us and the way we work, it&#x27;s a great thing to share.
3) Engage your readers in the process
Interactivity is a great opportunity to captivate readers.
4) Ask
Here we are not talking about questions to engage the audience, but to find expertise for your project - involve in the product, not in the tweet.
5) Shine a light on what&#x27;s behind the scene
Most of the work on the product is not visible to customers, but this does not mean that it should not be shown.
6) Story of today
Life is not always a routine, unusual events or experiments are a great opportunity to share them
7) Tell how you feel
Tell about your feelings about creating something.Creation is always a gamut of emotions.
8) Breakdown metrics&#x2F;milestone
Dry numbers are not catchy, but how you achieved this is a completely different story.
9) Uncover the value of a new feature
Do not tell what you did, tell what it will give to the user
10)Harsh truth
Moving forward, we often see and feel the hidden side.#BuildinPublic is a great opportunity to show it. Honesty wins.
11)Show your toolbox
Thor has a hammer, Captain America has a shield, but what do you have?
12) We all are people
We all have ups and downs. This is completely normal and part of the creation of any product

"Is it nonsensical? Does it need a lot of assumptions?<p>TLDR - The Earth is a breadboard and humans decided to arrange themselves in such a way that they created an immense circuit that could be made into a schematic to be replicated. It data packs every choice each performer makes(singer, composer, carpenter, painter, marketer, observer) in their lives over a duration until observation. Is it safe to consider this is an analog what they meant?<p>-<p>A great operatic area is the product of many threads of choices from composers (tone arranger), singers (tone generators), carpenters (set creators), painters (set decorators), etc. that over their lives chose to develop talents (some internal arousal). Then you have the observers who view the operation. For replication, depending on the era that the opera was created and first rendered the replication and want to re-view it or expand viewership the adding more observers would be word to mouth. In a modern era that moment of orchestration could be captured on video and marketed online. This opens even MORE human interaction and duration because the humans over time moved technology to the point where the quality of sampling rate has moved from poor audio to obscenely realistic video. Then there are people who may have heard it at a lower sample rate and prefer it vs new sampling rates which are incidental data inputs in and of themselves.  And as people die new generations pick up positions in the orchestration the decisions they chose, the biological improvements for tone generations one person may have, or a more expressive actor may impact the observers more than a previous one. That last aspect, is very much like iteration over PCB designs where you may swap out an old technology for a new one that does the job more efficiently.<p>Or maybe I am way off and my exercise at Duck Typing the humanities to circuit design is whimsical and lacking…<p>edit: for some clarity around word to mouth and modern marketing",general

Could the employee have been ordered to do the work and would it have been a breach of contract for the employee to not do it?

"I run www.4dayweek.io (Software Jobs with a better work &#x2F; life balance) and recently I&#x27;ve talked to 100+ companies trying to convince them to offer their developer roles on a 4 day work week - for many companies they simply aren&#x27;t interested.<p>Here are some common responses:<p>- We are a start up working hard to launch so it wouldn&#x27;t work for us. I read this as: &quot;we&#x27;ve advertised this as full time, but really it&#x27;s 24&#x2F;7&quot;<p>- It would require too much effort to change our current culture.

I always find it interesting when companies who struggle to attract top talent don’t consider offering a benefit such as a 4 day week. The law of diminishing returns means there is little difference between the output in a 4 vs 5 day week. This is also due to Parkinson’s Law.<p>If there was a financial incentive, however, I feel many of these companies would be more inclined to offering a 4 day week.<p>So my question is, if you weren&#x27;t able to get a 4 day work week job (e.g. 32hrs) on a full salary, would you accept a small reduction in salary? Or would you instead stick to 5 days @ 100% salary?<p>I&#x27;ve also created a poll on Twitter asking this [1]. So if you have a moment to give your honest reply, I&#x27;d really appreciate it.

"so the key question here is what a &quot;mid-level&quot; engineer can do for your company early.  An engineer with 5 years of experience at FAANG will easily make ~200-250k, competitive scaling startups and public companies will compensate equivalently withing ~30% in liquid compensation.<p>If that engineer instead works for 100k and takes 100k in illiquid equity which may or may not be worth something in 10 years, they are losing well over a million dollars in opportunity. Given that 5 more years at a top-tier firm would double their compensation they could easily be giving up multiple millions.  To be employee #5-50 this individual should be getting an equity option that would reasonably be worth millions in an exit scenario for it to make sense.<p>Most startups simply aren&#x27;t competitive for this mid-level engineer given current compensation practices.  Which leads to a sub-selection of talent for those who for various reasons aren&#x27;t willing or able to work at a firm willing to pay that level of compensation.  Bear in mind, if the engineer had liquid equity from a public corporation they would be able to leave equity in hand after 4 years.<p>Whether this is a problem or not is an interesting question for startup CEOs. Generally I&#x27;ve found success in software is more closely correlated to the quality of employees than the quantity, and historically companies with generous compensation practices seem to be the successful ones.",job/career

"Hi everyone! My name’s Aly, and I’m the founder of UPchieve (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upchieve.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upchieve.org</a>). I’m here with UPchieve’s CTO, Dave (thedevelopnik). We’re an edtech nonprofit that provides free, 24&#x2F;7 online tutoring to low-income high school students.<p>The idea for UPchieve was based on my own personal experience as a low-income student. I was raised by a single mom who was an immigrant to the US and often couldn’t help me with schoolwork and applying to college. So I went to a community college, and from there it took me 6 years to transfer to and graduate from a 4-year university.<p>College is not the only way for a low-income student to achieve upward mobility, but research shows it’s one of the most reliable. That was the story for me, too. Transferring to Penn helped me get a job on the trading floor at J.P. Morgan, where I immediately made 3x as much as my mom straight out of college.<p>I soon began looking for ways to give back and help other students like me get to college. Volunteering as a math tutor seemed like a great choice because I had tutored my way through HS and college and knew a lot about it, but I couldn’t find any existing volunteer opportunities that fit with my work schedule.<p>That’s when I first came up with the idea for UPchieve: an open source platform that could meet the needs of both younger-student-me (who needed help with schoolwork and college apps, often late at night in my home) and older-volunteer-me (who needed a flexible and convenient way to give back). Students can use UPchieve 24&#x2F;7 to request and get paired with a live tutor in 5 mins, and volunteers select their availability and then wait for a text notifying them that a student needs their help. You can see a demo of both the student and volunteer side of the platform here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SufRUje0XiM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SufRUje0XiM</a><p>Over the next two years, I realized that many other people cared about what I was doing and wanted to volunteer to help build the platform and tutor students. I also learned more about the state of education in the US and discovered that the gap in college completion rates between low- and high-income students hadn’t changed at all in 10+ years! This led me to grow more and more passionate about both the need for and potential of a platform like UPchieve. In 2018, I finally quit my job at J.P. Morgan to work on UPchieve full-time, with the new goal of scaling free tutoring to all low-income HS students across the US.<p>UPchieve is completely free for eligible students, and it only costs us $10 to give one student an entire year of unlimited academic support. For reference: online tutoring companies charge students $35 per hour on average. Other existing nonprofit tutoring models are prohibitively expensive and difficult to scale, due to factors like 1) cost of paid tutors, 2) in-person delivery, and 3) long-term commitments required of students and tutors.<p>We’re also working to become 100% self-sustaining (i.e., not dependent on donations). Companies like Verizon and Goldman Sachs pay us to provide virtual volunteer opportunities to their employees. Many big companies have budgets set aside specifically for volunteer opportunities because studies have found that employees who volunteer are more likely to stay at the company.<p>So far, we’ve helped more than 7,000 students and matched more than 30K on-demand requests for tutoring. My favorite part of my job has been reading the hundreds of comments we get from students each month, telling us how we’re helping them kick ass in their classes and that they can’t imagine life without us. It’s literally the best feeling ever. You can see some of my favorite student feedback here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1w3nqHSNiP-2270_Qxjvy367oRAU9Cn03gSJh7dGT5Lw&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1w3nqHSNiP-2270_Qxjvy...</a><p>If you like what we’re doing and want to help, please consider signing up to volunteer—we especially need more statistics, calculus, and physics tutors!

"I get that. The important bit is that there are a lot of other important concerns besides the type system--tooling, ecosystem, ease of finding&#x2F;onboarding collaborators, etc. Personally I think Rust is the only of these languages which ticks most of these boxes, and even then Rust makes you think about ownership all the time. I think there&#x27;s space for a GC&#x27;ed Rust (&quot;Rust-lite&quot;) or an OCaml with a familiar syntax and really great support (last I checked, ReasonML is still a confusing mess).

"Hi there,<p>I&#x27;m new to HN, so please bear with me here... coming from Slashdot (remember that?) and Stack, I found HN&#x27;s discussions to be incredibly refreshing, a mixture of fascinating submissions and intelligent commentary. Reminds me of the good ol&#x27; days of the internet, especially compared to the post-apocalyptic wasteland that reddit has become.<p>That said, I also find HN&#x27;s UX&#x2F;UI pretty difficult to use. It&#x27;s hard to see which stories have the most upvotes, for example, besides a tiny gray vote count under each story. There are no topic or time period filters. Inside the comments, there&#x27;s no way to sort them (hotness, newness, top) or collapse them (either individual threads, or the whole chain to the top replies).<p>Now, none of those are dealbreakers, obviously, and I would never want to see HN turn into the acidic glop that reddit is now, with a bunch of meaningless icons and colors everywhere, like MySpace all over again. But some basic usability features would be very welcome. In the olden days, old.reddit.com had the &quot;Reddit Enhancement Suite&quot; browser extension, which made browsing &amp; reading quite easy and pleasurable.

"Is it just hot air? Some big claims... I want someone to try and scale it til it breaks haha<p>“ Internet Computer is a digital token that runs on its own proprietary protocol called Internet Computer Protocol, which is supposed to let anyone build software or publish content on the Internet without using services from big companies like Amazon, Google, or Facebook. The protocol, according to Dfinity founder Dominic Williams, provides a “hackproof platform,” reduces costs “dramatically,” and is interoperable. He also says that the protocol is intended to make the Internet “fun again,” by allowing people to build a “new open Internet” and give users a “better deal.”<p>The idea is similar to other blockchain cryptocurrencies that use smart contracts, or computer codes that serve as a kind of agreement between parties, to exchange currencies.”",web/mobile
"Jess and Jo here, and we&#x27;re excited to share Ditto with you all (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dittowords.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dittowords.com</a>). Ditto is a way to manage product copy–or the text found on user interfaces–all the way from design to development. Think of a headless CMS but with the text from your design files.<p>We think product copy is one of the highest ROI aspects of product development today, but also one of the most overlooked. Even more so than the visuals, the text users read is critical to shaping their understanding of how things work. Copy often gets coupled as a part of design or neglected as hard-coded strings, even though it&#x27;s touched by everyone from design to legal to marketing to engineering. Lack of tooling specifically for copy means it often gets copy-pasted between a patchwork of tools intended for other use cases.<p>Jo and I have been on teams at both small startups and tech giants, and at every place we&#x27;ve seen product copy being written ad-hoc and scattered across mockups, docs, sheets, and tickets. The back and forth required just to fix a simple typo in production often included a backlogged ticket, several Slack conversations, and a ton of wasted engineering time better spent on building.<p>The two of us were fascinated by this problem–one that impacted the day-to-day of so many roles across a company but was rarely addressed. We decided to start working on it part-time while still in grad school and put together a simple landing page describing a tool that componentized product text. The response we got–emails from designers and developers from Salesforce to Square asking for a tool that didn’t yet exist–made us realize we had to pursue it full-time.<p>At its core, we wanted to build a way to treat product text as a system, with the ability to componentize text for reuse (just as we have components for development or design). We spent the last year building out and iterating on Ditto, deciding first to tackle how copy was managed between design files and content writers with our web-app and Figma integration.<p>However, our intent from day one has been to build a single source of truth from end to end, and have text from Ditto integrate into development. Initially, we took a stab at integrating into development by building a Github app that created pull requests for copy edits made in Ditto. This somewhat did the job (democratizing access to making text edits in development), but we saw users struggle with the maintenance it required. We realized it was a piecemeal solution to a system-level problem: Product text and “microcopy” (think text on buttons, error messages, etc.) has context, structure, and hierarchy just like any other content. Maintaining product copy as scattered, hard-coded strings, however, stripped it of its surrounding context.<p>We decided instead to build out an API (with a companion CLI and React SDK) so that Ditto could function similarly to a headless CMS and sync text from design all the way to production. The API&#x2F;CLI fetches up-to-date product copy from Ditto (and the designs) into local directories as structured JSONs with unique IDs for text and text groups. As a locally hosted and updated JSON, you always own your copy, can see copy diffs on commits, and won&#x27;t have to worry about latency (we&#x27;re not a CDN).<p>To check it out (with a quick 3 min video of me talking through the features), you can go to: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dittowords.com&#x2F;developers"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dittowords.com&#x2F;developers</a>.

We anticipate that the HN community has members, teammates, or friends that work on product teams, whether as developers, designers, product managers, legal or other roles that touch copy. We’d love to hear how your team currently manages copy — and most importantly your feedback.

"What?<p>The explosion is over. Software is ubiquitous. I’d like to treat software engineering like a real engineering profession. I didn&#x27;t say prevent the volume of people from participating. Rather, incorporate a credentialing system so that maybe your fresh grad or boot-camper isn’t working 18hr days on standing up core infrastructure without the experience to push back against manipulative management or ridiculous client timelines. Prioritizing security will only happen if all engineers require it (otherwise you’d be undercut by someone who doesn&#x27;t care). <i>That’s</i> why you need governance. We all have to be on the same page about security and reliability and it just happens that not everyone is equally qualified to <i>do security</i> or has the edge to build really reliable systems. And sometimes engineers just need to be protected from themselves even if they are experienced and qualified. It’s easy to say you’ll do that later when there aren’t immediate consequences for not. And we all know how often “later” becomes “never”.<p>Nothing I’ve described prevents innovation. You can still build your sloppy app really fast and throw it at the wall because it’s probably not doing anything important. But if you’re getting hired commissioned whatever to build real software that keeps industrial systems running or puts things in space or handles personal information or blasts messages at millions of people all at once, etc., there should be a framework to help you communicate costs to people.<p>Building code exists to prevent houses from falling over. Healthcare credentials exist to prevent damage to human life. As much as I hate the fact that we depend so much on oil, the industry is fundamentally important and the software that operates it should be secure because people run the gas stations when it’s not.

"This isn&#x27;t an attestation of personhood. This is attestation of access to a hardware module with certain properties. These are very different things. Obnoxiously different. Do any of the listed manufacturers implement any sort of rate limiting? If not, then it would be quite easy to set up a farm of yubikeys, and solve captchas for an arbitrarily low rate.<p>Also, what is the cost of a single one of these keys? If it&#x27;s relatively high (say, $50 each), then this would keep out a large portion of the 4 billion people that cloudflare claims to be seeking to help. If relatively low, then it would enable a farm to be run quite cheaply, even with aggressive rate limiting on each key.<p>So this does not at all prove personhood, it proves access to money. In that sense, it is nearly identical to a proof of work system. The parallels are actually quite amusing. Recall the slogan &quot;one computer, one vote&quot;, which was originally applied to bitcoin, until someone noticed that custom hardware could compute hashes order of magnitude faster than a pc could.

K is an adjustable parameter, so it can be made longer than whatever the time it takes for captcha solving services to work.<p>&gt;The very idea that we’re all wasting 500 years per day on the Internet — that nobody had revisited the fundamental assumptions of CAPTCHAs since the turn of the century — seemed absurd to us.<p>We aren&#x27;t, and someone has. The majority of people don&#x27;t fill out any captchas, ever. Google, in its great benevolence and wisdom, monitors their browsing habits. If it determines them to be reflective of a human, then when they click the recaptcha button, it will let them through without a hitch. A very small minority of users behave in ways that are suspect, such as by rejecting cookies, resetting their browsing history, or using tor. These are the users that face frequent captchas.

"Jess and Jo here, and we&#x27;re excited to share Ditto with you all (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dittowords.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dittowords.com</a>). Ditto is a way to manage product copy—or the text found on user interfaces—all the way from design to development. Think of a headless CMS but with the text from your design files.<p>We think product copy is one of the highest ROI aspects of product development today, but also one of the most overlooked. Even more so than the visuals, the text users read is critical to shaping their understanding of how things work. Copy often gets coupled as a part of design or neglected as hard-coded strings, even though it&#x27;s touched by everyone from design to legal to marketing to engineering. Lack of tooling specifically for copy means it often gets copy-pasted between a patchwork of tools intended for other use cases.<p>Jo and I have been on teams at both small startups and tech giants, and at every place we&#x27;ve seen product copy being written ad-hoc and scattered across mockups, docs, sheets, and tickets. The back and forth required just to fix a simple typo in production often included a backlogged ticket, several Slack conversations, and a ton of wasted engineering time better spent on building.<p>The two of us were fascinated by this problem—one that impacted the day-to-day of so many roles across a company but was rarely addressed. We decided to start working on it part-time while still in grad school and put together a simple landing page describing a tool that componentized product text. The response we got—emails from designers and developers from Salesforce to Square asking for a tool that didn’t yet exist—made us realize we had to pursue it full-time.<p>At its core, we wanted to build a way to treat product text as a system, with the ability to componentize text for reuse (just as we have components for development or design). We spent the last year building out and iterating on Ditto, deciding first to tackle how copy was managed between design files and content writers with our web-app and Figma integration.<p>However, our intent from day one has been to build a single source of truth from end to end, and have text from Ditto integrate into development. Initially, we took a stab at integrating into development by building a Github app that created pull requests for copy edits made in Ditto. This somewhat did the job (democratizing access to making text edits in development), but we saw users struggle with the maintenance it required. We realized it was a piecemeal solution to a system-level problem: Product text and “microcopy” (think text on buttons, error messages, etc.) has context, structure, and hierarchy just like any other content. Maintaining product copy as scattered, hard-coded strings, however, stripped it of its surrounding context.<p>We decided instead to build out an API (with a companion CLI and React SDK) so that Ditto could function similarly to a headless CMS and sync text from design all the way to production. The API&#x2F;CLI fetches up-to-date product copy from Ditto (and the designs) into local directories as structured JSONs with unique IDs for text and text groups. As a locally hosted and updated JSON, you always own your copy, can see copy diffs on commits, and won&#x27;t have to worry about latency (we&#x27;re not a CDN).<p>To check it out (with a quick 3 min video of me talking through the features), you can go to: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dittowords.com&#x2F;developers"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dittowords.com&#x2F;developers</a>.

We anticipate that the HN community has members, teammates, or friends that work on product teams, whether as developers, designers, product managers, legal or other roles that touch copy.

While this is theoretically true the reality was more nuanced; you had to know HTML&#x2F;CSS in order to style your applications and you had to know a wee bit of jQuery to make things happen on the page when you didn&#x27;t want to trigger a &quot;postback&quot; (their proprietary term for a POST request laden with the requisite ViewState and session magic). The _real_ magic of ASP .NET was implicit state management... you didn&#x27;t have to know anything about sessions, cookies, HTTP, CSRF, or LocalStorage (which, sadly, was around for some of Web Forms&#x27;s heyday because many devs clung onto it for much longer than they should have). The whole point of Web Forms was to replicate the WinForms experience in a web context so that devs didn&#x27;t have to reason so much about client vs server state.

"Anyone who&#x27;s worked on the PGP project would be the first to tell you that PGP does not and cannot encrypt the email&#x27;s metadata (to&#x2F;from, subject, timestamps, etc).<p>All PGP does is encrypt the inner message body. All of the metadata that TLAs love to analyze is sent in the clear (at best inside a TLS connection, although the SMTP protocol unfortunately makes it incredibly easy for well-positioned network attackers to downgrade these connections to in the clear)",web/mobile
"<p><pre><code>  fn punch_card() -&gt; impl std::fmt::Debug {
</code></pre>
This is a function that returns some type that implements Debug. Not specifically named.<p>The rest of it is a combination of two syntaxes: .. and ..=<p>These are both ranges. The former exclusive, the latter inclusive. You can write something like 1..5 (or 1..=5) to get a range from 1 to 5 inclusive&#x2F;exclusive, but you can also leave the start or end off: 2.. will give you from 1 till the end, ..=5 will give you from the start to 4. This means that .. will give you the full range. It looks more normal when used in context:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {
        let s = &quot;some string&quot;;
        let some = &amp;s[..=4]; &#x2F;&#x2F; you&#x27;d probably write ..5 but i wanted to show both syntaxes
        let string = &amp;s[5..];
    
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, some);
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, string);
    }
    </code></pre>
prints &quot;some&quot; and then &quot;string&quot;.<p>So, here&#x27;s the tricky bit: you can overload what the range is over. They&#x27;re not just for numbers. So:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {
        let mut string = &#x27;a&#x27;..=&#x27;z&#x27;;
        let a = string.next();
        let b = string.next();
    
        println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, a);
        println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, b);
    }
    </code></pre>
prints &quot;Some(&#x27;a&#x27;)&quot; and then &quot;Some(&#x27;b&#x27;)&quot;, because iterators return Options.<p>So... all of this means that, you can implement a range of ranges. And so this string builds up a ridiculous unbounded range of unbounded range of unbounded range of ...",web/mobile

You&#x27;d have to sandbox the analyzer.  Let it run arbitrary code but don&#x27;t let it do IO.  That can be pretty tricky to do for a language not designed to be sandboxed.<p>Safest way would probably be something hilarious like having the analyzer compiled to WASM and ran in node.js.,web/mobile
"From what I&#x27;ve seen, most frontend Rust development is focusing on replacing C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;C# frontends, not necessarily for websites or even really desktop applications.<p>With that being said, I have written a few GTK+ applets in Rust, and I gotta say that it&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds or looks. The current GTK crate supports Glade, meaning that you don&#x27;t have to <i>actually</i> write your frontend in Rust, rather building it in a different program, exporting it as glorified XML and binding the intractables to different buttons and fields. A hello world-styled GTK demo is only a few lines, and of course you get a wickedly performant binary out of the process too (mine used 4mb of memory, which could have been further optimized).",web/mobile
"Well, the ability to specify python version by module would&#x27;ve made migration much easier for everyone (in theory). But you&#x27;re quite right that it wouldn&#x27;t by itself be a solution -- it would also have required additional complexity to handle interoperability when calling between python versions, both in the runtime and the programs themselves (even a sufficiently smart compiler can&#x27;t figure out what string encoding a python2 function expects).",web/mobile
"Whether it&#x27;s an environmental improvement depends on what your employees do on the day off.

There are very few companies where everyone wants to work 4 days, let alone have that day not be flexible, so closing the office for a day seems out of reach for all but the smallest businesses. Retention I&#x27;m also not so sure about, virtually every company in our line of work supports 36 or 32 hours per week and they virtually all pay proportional to hours so that&#x27;s all same same.",web/mobile
